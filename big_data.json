We had been dating for over 4 years and out of the blue, she wanted to break up. I thought things had been going great. We had been talking about getting married and moving in together and all of a sudden, she wanted to end things. The day before, we had been making anniversary plans and when I called her the next day, she said we should cancel them and we should break up. I tried talking to her and even drove out an hour just to talk to her but she refused to give me any other information. \n\nNot sure if relevant, but she had closed off to me in the past and broken up out of nowhere. During those times, I tried really hard to reach out and try to resolve things but this time, I was just tired. So for about a year, I didn't talk to her and just felt shitty about the whole situation. A few months ago, I was hanging out with some mutual friends and they were telling me about her new BF. It's been like a year at that point. I\"m still a little sore about it but she can date whoever she wants. But as we're talking, I realize that their \"anniversary\" overlaps with the time when she and I were still dating for a period of a few months. I was devastated. \n\nOf course I minded the cheating but I was more upset that she didn't tell me THIS was the reason. I spent months blaming myself for ruining what I had perceived to be a perfect relationship. This made me really upset to the point where I fell into a little bit of a depressive state. I had doubts about ever finding someone and had panic attacks about how I could trust anyone in the future. \n\nRecently, I got back into dating and I'm reminded of this whole situation again and I feel like shit. So I had a guy's night out and got trashed. At the end of the night, I ended up texting her and telling her she should've just told me about it and that I know I know why she broke up with me. I realize it's been over a year and maybe I should've just moved on. But am AITA for bringing it up when she's happily moved on with someone else? (Side note, a few of my friends think they are getting engaged soon haha....)", "Wibtah, me(t) my girlfriend (j) and girlfriends sister(m)\n\nI\u2019ve been with j for 4 years now, we\u2019ve had our ups and downs and broke up for a week in that time, otherwise we\u2019re happy. \n\nLast week m comes to me and says don\u2019t tell j I told you this but, j\u2019s been going on dates with another guy behind your back. I was upset but grateful m told me this. M did show me proof so it\u2019s not just a sister fight, and no myself and m don\u2019t have feelings for each other.\n\nI let this sink in and how I was going to confront j, I came up with the idea to leave a used condom in her car because that\u2019s where she was fooling around with this guy. I figure I\u2019d offer to detail j\u2019s car one day and come across the condom and confront her this way so that m doesn\u2019t get involved in a argument with j. I just want to make it look like j and this guy were careless and that\u2019s how I found out. My brother thinks lying to j makes me an ass because he knows I hate confrontation and I want to take the easy way out. So am I a ass for setting her up?", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Last year for my 16th birthday, I really wanted an IPhone 7 or 8 because I was tired of my little 6s and wanted something nice for my big birthday. I made sure everyone knew what I wanted, and I said if it wasn\u2019t that then I\u2019d just like money, to maybe save up and buy it myself. \n\nWell, no, everyone wanted to get me a name plate necklace instead. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of jewelry, no matter how much my very feminine mother and grandmother would like me to, I just don\u2019t see the big deal. I\u2019ll wear big hoop earring if I want to look cute, but other than that I\u2019ll just occasionally wear rings. Necklaces aren\u2019t my thing, and I never see the real value of true gold or silver. \n\nI told that I definitely did not want that at all. I didn\u2019t want anyone to waste their money getting me something I wouldn\u2019t like, so I was very very adamant about nobody getting it. I said if they didn\u2019t want to get me the phone that would be fine, but I just really didn\u2019t want the necklace. So, for my birthday that year I got a violin, money, and the IPhone 6s+.\n\nThis year, however, I\u2019m away from home at college. Less time for people to be around me asking me what i want. Nobody asked me what I wanted for my birthday. \n\nMy dad sent me a laptop that\u2019s a slight upgrade from my old one, and my grandma sent me money. I liked the gifts a lot and thanked them. My mother had been excitedly telling me that she ordered my birthday gift and it should be there a few days after my birthday. I asked her what it was and she said she didn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise. \n\nOn the day of my birthday, I get a notification that I have a package. I go to see what it is, and when I open it up, it\u2019s a name plate necklace. A real gold name plate necklace with my birthstone in the center. I was confused because the only person who would get me jewelry knowing I\u2019m not a big fan is my grandma, but she already sent her gift. \n\nTurns out it was from my mother. I\u2019m extremely underwhelmed. To be blunt, I hate the necklace. I put it on to please her and just left it on so she wouldn\u2019t complain about me wasting her money. I know it was extremely expensive but i hate it. I did say thank you and tell her it was pretty, and I didn\u2019t tel her to her face that I hated it. \n\nWhen I mentioned it to my friend, she said I\u2019m being spoiled and selfish because my mother didn\u2019t HAVE to get me anything. I know she didn\u2019t, but I wish she wouldn\u2019t have got me anything rather than getting me a necklace that I told everyone a year ago that I did not want. AITA?\n\n****Edited for clarity****\n\nEdit #2: For everyone calling me a spoiled rich kid, I\u2019ll admit the rambling about the iPhone did come off that way, but i started with that to show you guys things i am into: tech and music. \n\nI\u2019m by no means rich. I don\u2019t get random presents out of the blue, I don\u2019t have a lot of things you might think i have. Originally i was going to mention that that year, my mom got herself the IPhone 7+ and gave me her 6s+ as a hand-me-down, saying her child should never have a better phone than her. So the phone was possible, I just didn\u2019t get it because my mother wanted it. I didn\u2019t throw a fit about that. I wanted an upgrade and i got one. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m so torn is because i love my mom and appreciate that she got me something, but i just hate what i got. I know i didn\u2019t have to get anything. I know that. Nobody asked me so I couldn\u2019t expect to magically get what I wanted, but that\u2019s the thing. She didn\u2019t ASK. If i was adamant about not getting it last year, i just don\u2019t understand why she would get it for me this year without asking if i had a change of heart. \n\nI never, ever, *ever* would tell my mother to her face that I hate the gift. She\u2019s under the impression that I like it. I didn\u2019t amplify my like of it either, I told her it was pretty and said thank you and I\u2019m wearing it. That\u2019s it.", "Me (21f) and my bf (25m) have been together for two years, we live together, and we see a long term future together. \n\nHis mom is a lovely woman, but very pushy. When I was 19 she told me she needed grandchildren in the next few years. My bf called her out for being hypocritical as she had him when she was 38, and he told her not to put pressure on me. However, this has only changed her approach in pushing grandchildren. She constantly talks about pregnancy, how having children younger is better, and (of course) how people should always stay close to their parents when they have kids. Something that is also hypocritical as she moved to a new country when she had my bf.\n\nWe are in no way planning to have children or get married anytime soon. My boyfriend even had another talk with her last week telling her that kids were at least 9 years away and she needed to stop. The next night she brought up pregnancy and kids again.  \n\nThis really stresses me out, and it's not only the idea of children, but how she talks about how children should be raised. She is very opinionated, believes any toy with plastic is just \"garbage,\" and doesn't believe in vaccinations. It gives me a headache to just think about having kids with her as a grandmother constantly breathing down my neck and criticizing my every parenting move.\n\nAND I'M ONLY 21!!!! I don't want to be thinking about this! Who knows if in 9 years children will even be the right choice for my partner and I! \n\nSo, the next time I see her and she brings it up I would like to mention that I do not want children. I'm hoping this would stump her a bit and if she protested it could be a good opportunity for me to draw clear boundaries that she has no right to tell me what to do with my future. It wouldn't be a complete lie as I really don't know what I will want in the future, but it feels a little deceptive and it might actually crush her...\n\nSo, my bf and I have decided to ask reddit WIBTA if I told her I didn't plan on having kids?", "First of all, we have very little exchange students in the college and the African or African-American people living in the country are also numbered. I started with that sentence because I think it will shed some more light into the boyfriend's mentality. The boyfriend (T) in question is a well-known casanova who takes his changes with almost every girl and about a month ago or so, he started dating an African-American exchange student (Y) who is hands-down gorgeous. Me and some of my friends couldn't really understand what she sees in him but didn't make any comments since it's none of our business and we were not that close with her anyways. We have a group chat which includes T and not Y yet we don't use it that much since it has all the people in our class and the subject is usually homework, exams, etc. The other day T sent a photo of him and Y to the group titled ''Proof'' of Love, he put the word proof in quotation marks and asked how they looked, it was odd but we still congratulated and didn't think much of it. And it went downhill from there, I was a little bit early for the lesson in the morning and was just checking some notes, T comes in cheerfully with some of his friends and they sit in front of me. They started making jokes about dark and white chocolate and which one tasted better etc. but I didn't get what they were talking about at that time. One of his friends said that he was taking it too far and he should just stop, he brushed him off and said ''Come on man, I already told you I'll break up with her as soon as I get some of that black pussy.'' I was shocked and said that ''This is too cruel even for you, T'' He just laughed and said it's none of my business. And yes, it isn't.   \n\n\nStill, it disturbs me a lot and I want to talk to Y. My friends think it's a shame yet still none of my business. WIBTA if I talk to the exchange student about what her boyfriend really thinks of her?", "My girlfriend is overly jealous most of the time. She accuses me of being a flirt and having girls fawn over my existence. According to her, I would have girls all over me in any situation. This is definitely not the case. My reunion is coming up in November. She wants to go \u201cto make sure everyone knows I have a girlfriend\u201d. She thinks that I am only going to see my \u201cold fuck buddys\u201d and doesn\u2019t trust me to be by myself. I have never cheated on her. The only time in my life I have cheated was on a girl in HS and I made the mistake of telling my GF this. I have since matured and would never consider cheating again. I think she\u2019ll just be pissed off the whole time and will be triggered by any communication I have at the reunion. I want to go to see my friends that I haven\u2019t seen in over a decade. AITA for not letting her come with me since I think she\u2019ll be pissed off the entire time?", "So this was last weekend for the first regular season game in the football season.\nMy mom has season tickets and I had my son who is 11 months old and wanted to take him to the game and asked my mother if she would take my son and me. So it was raining very bad out and I didnt want to take my kid on the public transit for how rainy it was and how young he was so we decided to drive to the stadium and park at the stadium. The second we got into the vehicle and started driving my mom started complaining saying we should have just taken the light rail and she doesnt want to pay for parking because she knows right now I'm not doing great financially and am living paycheck to paycheck with everything going on in my life. As we get closer she starts getting louder in the car and basically yelling at me for making her pay for parking. As we are on the highway about to get on to the main highway to get us to the stadium I have the choice of going north or south, north takes us to the game south takes us home and I looked at her and said,\" fine we don't need to go to the game so you dont need to pay for parking I can just turn around and we can go home\" she sits in silence for a second then continues to complain about how much she will spend on parking so at the last second I went south to go home which resulted in silence for the 25 min drive back to her house. When we got to her house I made the decision to just drop her off so when I pulled up she scoffs at me, gets out and slams my car door shut and makes a couple comments under her breath. I drove away and my son and me watched the game at a local restaurant.", "Tldr is basically title\n\nI\u2019d like to start by saying this was a number of years ago, but it still bothers me. \n\nI used to go on Skype fairly often, and one night I got a message from a woman telling me she found my name in a random Skype search. We had a normal conversation for a while before she started gearing the conversation towards her being a cam girl. Once it reached this point I\u2019d thought she was a bot, but our previous conversations were not bot-like at all. \n\nShe told me a story that her supposed \u201cfriend\u201d got her into the business and she\u2019d like me, a random kid on the internet, to watch her. I didn\u2019t want to but she sent me a link to her \u201ccam girl\u201d site, but of course as you know this was really just an obvious virus link. \n\nI didn\u2019t open it, but I gave her a request to \u201cget off\u201d on this certain \u201cvideo\u201d I like, and so I sent her a website link that\u2019s a screamer. I got blocked immediately after, so I assume it was opened. \n\nAt first I thought it was funny, so I told a certain friend of mine about it, who did not find it funny at all. She went off and told me I was a sh*tty person, even if the woman WAS a bot that my actions were still unacceptable. Ever since I\u2019ve really wanted to know, am I the asshole?", "This happened last Christmas but I kinda forgot about it until recently when we were making plans for this upcoming Christmas.\n\nSo the whole family went to my sister's house for Christmas day. This was planned ahead of time. Her husband is wearing only his boxers and is watching Stargate in the living room. Not like it's early morning and he just woke up when we got there this was like at noon. So I was talking to my brother about how that's pretty rude. And my brother says \"It's his house he can do what he wants.\" And everyone else agreed with him. But I think that only really applies if it's a casual thing. This was a big family event where they knew ahead of time they were hosting. Since I was the only one that saw an issue with it I'm curious if that makes me the asshole or if my entire family is insane.", "Background:\n\n~ I was raised Catholic, but also had a lot of superstitions and folk magic as I have a very old school mexican family. \n\nDuring my childhood, we moved to a new church that was closer, there we were shunned and socially judged because of these beliefs. The judgement from this congregation tore deep rifts in my family which still has effects lasting today. All in all, we were all hurt badly, and avoid religious things because of the bad memories. (I think we have PTSD..... not joking, it was seriously bad but in not going to go into it)\n\n~ Me and my MIL have a tenuous relationship, and she knows the whole story about my family past since she and my mother were once very close friends.\n\nStory:\n\nMy husband had his birthday recently, and his family came over to treat us to dinner. With them they brought a card and a big box (duh it's a birthday right?), well inside wasn't a normal gift but a huge crucifix. \n\nHis mom is religious and only recently started going back to church, so now shes all about it.\n\nThe crucifix is okay, but I think it came from a bad space as she knows the whole story about my family and the hurt but decided to give it to us anyways. So I believe it has some passive aggressive I'll intent. \n\nAlso it's just inappropriate as her son isn't religious at all. He literally doesnt care. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting something hanging in my home that gives me bad memories and was given to me by a person who knows the history and actively tries to throw wrenches in me and my husbands husband's relationship?", "[deleted]", "My daughter has complained a few times recently and gotten annoying about not letting her see R-rated movies (like the recent Child's Play remake and the It movies).\n\nI'm thinking about getting the DVD for this one once it's out and telling her to go watch that as a sort of \"scare them straight\" thing. I'm frankly amazed this movie in its form got an R rating and didn't require edits to go below NC-17. I could tell that the adults in the theater were unnerved and distressed.\n\nAnd then if she has such a reaction I could tell her \"well you told me you wanted to see R-rated horror movies!\"\n\nToo asshole of an idea?", "This guy is roughly 65-70, and is a casual acquaintance of my mom's (she doesn't really see him if she doesn't want to). I just graduated college and he just retired from the field I got my degree in.\n\nMy mom got us in contact with each other and he took me to several places around my city to meet people working in my field. He kept asking me my political views on things like gay marriage, marijuana etc.\n\nOnce he figured out I was a Democrat he told me that he was gay. Whatever. NBD. This is in a VERY red state mind you, so big risk I guess. \n\nWhat was the problem, was that after this, he started asking me about my sex life, whether I watch porn, weird stuff like that that made me really uncomfortable. He also kept calling me his \"special friend\" because I was one of only a few people who knew he was gay.\n\nAnyway I got really creeped out about all the really personal questions, and I stopped texting him and going places.

A guy took it and I put everything in my account. Thing is, one of the games belonged to my sister, GTA5. She never owned a PS4, only used mine for years and no longer lived here. So I did not really think about it but when I told here she got pissed, like really pissed. She did hold a grudge for a long time. I ended up buying her the game back for Christmas (might be an A for this one as she did not ask for it) even if she did not own a PS4. She bought one later though. So am AITA on this one?\n\n\nEdit: was GTA5, not the 4\n\nEdit 2: looks like the votes are going one way. So it was an honest mistake but I should have bought it back to her right away (or give her the money) and not make it a petty revenge on Christmas. Thank you for your votes.\n\nFinal edit/update: I decided to double gift her this Christmas and will apologize. Your input helped me figure out I was in the wrong there.", "[deleted]", "Note: I'm older (late 40s) but I guess you're never too old to be an asshole, or at least wonder if you are.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for about 10 months. I'm divorced and she's a widow if it matters. I work a lot to pay for alimony and to put my kids through college. \n\nShe says that we don't see each other enough and she's probably right so it's not too important to go over that.\n\nAbout a week ago I wasn't feeling very good and she suggested that I go to the emergency room. While I was there the doctors discovered that I had a pretty bad infection which would require a lot of antibiotics. There was also some question as to whether I had a larger problem such as sepsis or even a massive infection in the bloodstream. Needless to say, I was worried.\n\nWhile we were making small talk or discussing what might be wrong with me she decides to bring up, once again, that we don't see each other enough and that she doesn't feel all that connected. I told her that I agreed we don't see each other enough but that I couldn't really talk about it.\n\n\nThe next day, she asks if I wanted her to come visit. I know from experience that once she's brought up not seeing each other enough she's going to keep bringing it up every time we are together until we talk about it. So I told her that I would love her to come see me, but that I didn't have the strength to talk about anything too deep. She replied that she would be able to visit but that she couldn't promise that she would be able to avoid the subject of our relationship. I repeated that I would love to see her but that if the conversation turned to anything heavier than work or friends then I would not be able to carry on a decent conversation but that I could talk about it when I was out of the hospital. I did say that if there was anything else on her mind (work, her elderly mom, etc.) I would be glad to talk about that but that my tank was already running pretty low and I wasn't sure what good I'd be. \n\n\nShe then said \"I guess you don't want me to visit then.\" I felt like I was being manipulated a bit so I replied that if that was how she wanted to look at it then OK.

Growing up something was always more important than my birthday, and while I realise that I sound like a little shit, it's also taken its toll over the years on my relationship with my sisters and mother. My Dad always made sure that I had at least one thing that would make me smile that day but he passed away in 2012, never getting to meet my daughter, who was born in 2014. To add on to that my life long best friend was killed in 2016 and my Grandmother passed this past Christmas. I do not get along with my mother or sisters, but they are the only family I have left and they all live in Ohio. I live in North Carolina and my in-laws all live in Pennsylvania. \n\nFor my daughters first birthday I had a small party for her at home, but was told to plan two parties...the one at home and the one my sister-in-law was throwing in PA. That's an 8 hour drive away. My husband's family has a lot more money than my family and it is painfully obvious. So now I have my  butthurt mother and sisters up my ass because I didn't throw a third birthday party in Ohio, because \"it's not fair\".  This stressed me out so badly that I said that from now on there will be no traveling or no visits during her birthday. I want to worry about her birthday and not the back and forth saltiness between the two families. \n\nWe don't have room in our house for more than one person to stay here and the closest hotel is over 20 miles away. I made this rule in 2015 and yet every.... single.... year they still make passive aggressive jabs at me for being selfish and not letting them railroad me into taking over her birthday. I said they can come the week before or the week after Halloween, but not the week of and it's just not good enough. I'm at a loss and I'm starting to hate her birthday too. Am I the asshole for just wanting my child to have a day that is all about her?", "I'm a first time poster on this subreddit and not a native speaker.\n\nSo first the backstory. My mother had me while on drugs all her pregnancy. I came out normal tho. She got my father into drugs and beat him sometimes. My mother didn't do shit for me. After my father left I was all alone. I knew he loved me at least a little because he tried his best to give me a better life. He drove me to the hospital after my mother left me lying on the floor wit a broken leg. He said in court he's no good father but neither is she so I should go to my grandparents. Wich I did with my little sister of course( for who I cared for my entire life up to that point) My grandparents are giving me a really good life even if they sometimes compare me to my mother when they're angry and I can't blame them. They were being stolen from and lied to. My mother is not allowed to have contact with me and sis. She is living her best life with my other shit grandparents. My father on the other hand is allowed to have contact but hasn't talked to us in like 6 years. We came to our grandparents 8 years ago. \n\n\n\nSo now my grandma received a letter from him.

I am honestly not surprised. \nEdit 2 : in the letter he adressed me too. \n\nTldr my father who I have no contact with since 6 ago wrote a letter to my grandparents and I wanna read it.", "So, as a preface this happened last month. Also, my first post:I went camping with a few friends that were in town. We were camping for one night and hiking the next day. There were 5 of us total, me and two couples. We all decided that we would let one person buy all the food and split the food costs evenly. This was one dinner meal, one breakfast meal, some snacks, and beer. When we arrived (I should also note, I drove 3 hours each way in my car in the Rocky Mountains) I asked the friend who purchased the food, lets call him James, how much I owed them in the split, and they said evenly it would be $50.\n\nNow, I'm no scrooge and I'm always happy to pay my fair share, but I felt that this was a little steep considering we were eating burgers, pancakes, and drinking coors lite for only one night. I asked to see a receipt. Turns out, the bill for everything was $150, and we just had a lot of nicer products. Jame's wife is a vegetarian and had her own separate food included in the bill, and I'm happy to help with her food as well, but it definitely added to the cost.Here is where I take issue. The bill was split 3 ways, 1/3 James and his wife, 1/3 the other couple, 1/3 me by myself. My wife was not with us because she had to work, and I felt that it was unfair that I was expected to cover 1/3 the bill while the other two paid \"as a couple\" instead of individually.\n\nI was bothered by this and brought it up, explaining that it wasn't exactly even, but I was told by both couples that it made sense to them. Their logic was because James was paying, and the other male was paying, the women shouldn't have to. Normally, I'd be chivalrous and agree, but my wife wasn't there, so I don't think that it makes sense. I offered to pay $30, which would have been 1/5 the costs instead of 1/3, but they all said I was being ridiculous.\n\nAm I the asshole for not agreeing with this split?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit for clarity: My wife was never intending on coming on this trip, she clearly told everyone she had to work.

They divorced, he remarried, and they had my siblings and I.\n\nWhen I was a kid and heard that I had a brother for the first time, I was really curious. I asked about him and was basically told that their relationships turned sour about 30ish years ago and he had cut Dad out. Since then they had all pretended the other didn't exist. I was given zero detail about why this had come about.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, the brother reached out and asked me/my siblings if we wanted to get to know him. I was delighted, but the rest of the family discussed it and decided they didn't have any interest in the brother.\n\nI was an awkward teen at this point, and asked my parents if it would be ok if I just spoke to my brother. I said I had always been curious. Their reaction was fury and upset - my Mom burst into tears and said that my brother would 'turn me against the family' and they would 'lose me forever'. Being a teen I didn't really know how to react, so I reassured them that I wouldn't get involved. The brother's message went entirely ignored.\n\nThing is, I still want to know him. I know nothing but a name. I could have nieces and nephews out there, a whole family I've never met.\n\nNow I'm much older, I tried to find him myself. Just to say hi and let him know I'm here and happy to speak if he wants to. I'm pretty sure I found him on social media, and reached out with a simple, polite message. He blocked me.\n\nI'm sad about it, but I understand. Being soundly rejected a decade ago, of course he's moved on and doesn't want to get hurt again. It only intensified my regret at not standing up for myself as a teenager and reaching out.\n\nI suppose I should move on, given the circumstances, but I'm still curious.

I'm scared of this mystery weighing me down for the rest of my life.\n\nI want to ask my parents more about him. Not much, just a little.

My boyfriend immediately became angry because I didn\u2019t ask him about it first. \n\nConsider: she was not asking for OUR baby. She did not want mine or my boyfriends genes. She wanted her and her husband\u2019s baby, inside me. She has a medical condition where pregnancy may kill her. \n\nI don\u2019t think my boyfriend should have ANY say over what I do for my sister with my body. I would not be cheating on him, no sex involved in this pregnancy. It would be done medically. Then they get the baby. No responsibility on us other than I stay healthy. He\u2019s just mad that I would say yes without asking because he \u201cwill have to deal with the pregnancy.\u201d He doesn\u2019t want my body to change as it does with pregnancy and he doesn\u2019t want to deal with my mood swings because of hormonal changes. \n\nI think he\u2019s the asshole for thinking he has any right to say what I do with my body. He thinks I\u2019m the asshole for not considering him with what I do with my body. Even if it\u2019s for my sister, the person I am most close to and if it ever came to it, I would end the relationship with him if given an ultimatum. So either way, she\u2019s going to get a baby. Why do I even have to ask if what he says literally doesn\u2019t make a difference?\n\n\nUPDATE: to respond to questions, I have not had children before. We are not long distance, we live together. He was in the room when my sister asked, I didn\u2019t come home and say \u201cI\u2019m getting pregnant\u201d but he knows that this is really important to me and how close I am with my sister. I am positive that if the roles were reversed, she would do the same for me, and I just felt like yes, you\u2019ll have to deal with me pregnant if you want to stay, but I don\u2019t think I should have waited to respond to my sister because ultimately, what happens with my boyfriend and I because of it wouldn\u2019t affect my decision.\n\nAdditional UPDATE: Boyfriend and I are both young twenties. We've been together less than three years. If I was married to him and already committed to sharing my life with him, I may have paused. But saying this again: He was in the room and immediately got mad with me for responding. It wasn't that I had time to think about say \"ew fuck him,\" but I did know that I would NOT be refusing to have a baby for my sister. The details of the, where, how where not hammered out. I could have very easily agreed to wait to have my own kids first and then have hers. May have sped up both of our timelines but she means the world to me. I was pissed that he was pissed before even considering it. To who said I was putting a spin on it, absolutely not. His two reasons were mood and my body changing, which is the literal reason I think that even after considering his opinion, I don't care. Yes those are valid and will happen to me, but I think it's a bs reason to not want someone to do it. \n\nIt seems like the general consensus is that I am a raging bitch. Although I -still- say I would obviously prefer his support, his lack of support will not change my mind. Legally/medically, if I have to wait or have a kid first, So Be It. I honestly think that has no bearing on whether my decision was bad or not. It wouldn't have made it any less of a dick move if it was allowed without me having kids first, would it? Also- sister and husband would be paying all bills, supplements, maternity clothes, etc. I love the hell out of him but I've been in relationships before where people stopped me from doing things and having a life and I swore that it would never happen again, no matter how smitten. Maybe I over-corrected this attitude. \n\nBut things I did begin to consider that did not cross my mind (honestly, thank you, internet)\n1) He may want to experience pregnancy for his child first and I could potentially be depriving him of a special thing to him. I've only been considering the fact that he wants to deprive my sister of motherhood. I didn't think about him missing out on the \"firsts\" of pregnancy. \n2) Did not consider the fact I might not be able to work. I have known pregnant people and they dip out of work right before giving birth and wait a bit before coming back. However, my sister offered to let us live with her during the pregnancy. She was never going to be not heavily-involved. Nothing is expected of boyfriend in this situation except to let me do it without being callous. So I don't think money has a real issue here for him although I know it's a factor for my sister. \n3) Even though his opinion wouldn't change whether I would ultimately do it or not, he may have felt like his opinion in other things would not matter because of how quickly I replied to this situation. I agree I would not bring home a pet without talking to him. But I would never tell him whether or not to help out a family member, REGARDLESS of how it inconvenienced me. I do not think romantic relationships should dictate your relationship with everyone else. Sure, they can affect them, strain them, strengthen them. But whatever boy I am dating (I feel) has no right to protest MY sister's baby inside ME. I get that I'm asking a lot of him already to stick around. But I'm also ok if we DID put our relationship on hold because he didn't want to \"deal\" with my hormones and body.\n4) It may not be WHAT decision I made, but HOW I made the decision. Even if I value my sister's relationship more than mine with him, responding immediately just pulled it out into the open and threw it into his face when I could still have made the decision, but gentler for him. \n\nHope that doesn't count as arguing, not discounting anyone's opinion and I appreciate everyone who replied, even the ones who think I deserve to be alone for life. It gave me perspective because apparently other people (namely boyfriends) can legitimately feel entitled to parts of my life that I think they should have no say in. Just makes me rethink some other decisions I've made without asking. You're probably right that he puts up with a lot of shit to date me. I'm stubborn and argumentative and act before thinking. I'm emotional and passionate and respond how I honestly feel, but I don't act maliciously, even if I don't take the care to make sure I don't hurt whoever is around me. My assumptions skipped a lot of steps that would have been good to think about: like yes even though I WILL do it, I should give him notice. Give him the option of leaving or moving out before I do it. Or honestly, give him the option of finding someone else to have kids with and live with if he doesn't accept my faults (like impulsivity- working on it but obviously not very good at controlling it yet) like I accept his that can annoy me, although the point of this post is not to point out what's good and bad in both of us- it's a very isolated, Am I the Asshole, which apparently I am.

It's more like a lecture on how i need to be responsible when I tell them that I'm waiting for a sale every time.\n\nAs you can probably guess, this dinner wasn't the first time they brought up the issue of me studying hard overseas. I'll admit, after hearing the same shit come out of my Dad's mouth for the 10000th time over the course of the last year I got a bit pissed off and told him to drop. Nothing vulgar and rude. Just a simple: \"That's enough. We've had this conversation before I'm sick of listening to the same thing over and over again when I can't do anything about it\". Cue him flying off the handle talking about how I don't appreciate the good life I'm living now etc.\n\nBut this isn't even the worse part. The worst part is that after he got mad in the restaurant he said \"you know what, you can forget about your new phone\". This is when I blew up. The reason i got so mad is because like everything else, this isn't the first time he's pulled some similar shit. It's always the classic \"I promised you something but now i'm going to create a situation where you're rude to me so I can now use this as an excuse to back out of my promise\". When I was 5 it was a deck of Pokemon cards that I really wanted. When I was 8 it was a Moleskin calendar notebook, at 13 it was a football jersey, at 14 it was a wallet and then later a pair of headphones, at 16 an eggbeater so that I could cook for whoever came to the house for dinner. There are probably many more that I can't remember. Well this time he got out of the chair to leave the dinner half way and tried to create a scene in front of my family. So I kind of lost my shit and called him a \"15 year old in an adult's body man child\". AITA?", "Ok I swear it\u2019s not as bad as it seems.

Of course she rejected me and I thought that was that. This was Friday night. \n\nEdit: I get like this post needs some more backstory so basically I met this girl about two years ago at first we didn\u2019t talk much but then we started talking a lot. We had actually become really close friends. About 10 or so months after we started talking I started to develop feeling for her this was all about a year ago.

Today (Sunday) hits and one of my friends tells me that she thinks I\u2019m ignoring her.

I\u2019m not like that and even if I was I can constitute that sort of reaction if we stopped talking for like a week, but no it\u2019s been a day and a half so I think you need to chill out.\u201d\n\nH-\u201cDude like I said I don\u2019t like you in that way so don\u2019t get mad at me for it.\u201d\n\nM-\u201cYa I know that but I don\u2019t remember you texting me either so don\u2019t act like your above it all.\u201d \n\n(She\u2019s had history of acting like no one is perfect except her it\u2019s rare that she acts this way but sometimes I wonder if deep down she believes it)\n\nIt kind of puttered out from there for a couple minutes then we stopped talking and haven\u2019t talked since.

He's a great kid. My brother and SIL are pretty alright parents for the most part, but they are slobs and there house is very dirty. I'm not talking just cluttered and messy. It's filthy. Dirty dishes piled up and left everywhere for months, garbage everywhere, rotting food, clothes on the floor, diapers left laying about, dog pee left on the floor until it dries there, etc. They don't sweep, vacuum or mop. They don't wipe counters or clean up spills. The bathroom is so nasty, they don't clean the toilet or nephews training potty. It is so unsanitary and gross that I can't even stand being in their house. Several times I have come over to clean their house and cleaned it completely. I'm a former maid for very rich people, so when I say cleaned I mean freaking spotless. Spent 18+ hours each time cleaning it. And the next time I come over it's a freaking mess again. I've talked to them several times about how unacceptable this is, I've written out basic cleaning schedules, lectured them on how they need to do better for their son. I've told them that they a negligent and that if they don't get their shit together they could lose their son. But I can't seem to get it through their thick skulls. They show no signs of changing. My nephew deserves a better life than this. I've given them so many chances, I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm seriously debating calling CFS on them.

WIBTA?", "Background: My (28F) fianc\u00e9\u2019s (29M) dad has been a professor at an Ivy League university in our city for 30+ years. His position comes with benefits, including undergraduate tuition exemption for any kids under 26 and taxable tuition (explained below) for any kids in grad school.\r\n\r\n\r\nFianc\u00e9\u2019s parents divorced when he was young. Dad refused to pay child support for years which caused a lot of bitterness between him and mom. Mom did not hide her hatred, fianc\u00e9 grew up being told his dad didn\u2019t care about him \u2013 he has depression and a bad relationship with his mom, but when he got older and dad quit drinking, relationship with dad got better despite their past. \r\n\r\n\r\nFianc\u00e9 dropped out of college in \u201909 after his first semester and that\u2019s when we met and started dating. Next few years he went to community college near my college, we lived together (\u201811-\u201813) and his mom paid his rent, and after I graduated (\u201813) and moved back home he moved with me and lived with me at my mom\u2019s house rent-free (my mom is awesome and loves him like a son). We both worked for a few years (\u201814-\u201817) and in that time he decided he wanted to apply to finish his degree at his dad\u2019s school. He got in and bc he was still 26, paid no tuition for the next 2-3 years and finished his degree this past May. He got into a master\u2019s program (with a small scholarship) at the same school but now has to pay some tuition.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach year he has taken out a small loan ($8-10K) to help with living expenses, books etc. I am not working anymore (back in school) but with savings from my job and a substantial inheritance from my father, I keep us comfortable, pay rent and most bills, which I am fine with. However, I cannot afford to help my fianc\u00e9 with tuition (nor would I be allowed to since my inheritance is in a trust and heavily regulated).\r\n\r\n\r\nTaxable tuition 101: the tuition that would normally be paid is added onto the professor\u2019s income. If dad makes $100K/year and tuition is $20K, his income is considered $120K and he is taxed based on that amount. So if income tax is 30% of annual income, he pays $36K in taxes instead of $30K. This results in a loss of $6K for that year (none of these numbers are exact but also not too far off from the real numbers).\r\n\r\n\r\nDad does not want to lose this income and wants fianc\u00e9 to pay him back. My feeling is that he never paid child support, tuition, or living expenses for his son growing up (despite having the means), and this is a small price to pay for his neglect. Fianc\u00e9 told dad he can\u2019t afford to pay him back so dad said fine, he\u2019ll pay, and his girlfriend even offered to pay half. Recently they spoke again and dad reneged, he still wants money from fianc\u00e9 for tuition. This money would come out of the loan money he receives for living expenses which he already has to pay back. We think dad is being selfish and unreasonable. What do you think?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all your responses. In retrospect a more accurate query would have been \u201cAITA for suggesting/feeling like it would be the right thing for my fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad to not make my fianc\u00e9 pay him back for income lost due to taxable tuition?\u201d, mainly because some of the finer points were missed and my actual part in his conversation with his dad was misinterpreted due to my poor phrasing (I was not part of their conversation at all and merely offered my fianc\u00e9 my opinion), but I accept your judgment regardless and thank all of you for your time and thoughts.", "My brother was telling me about his chronically unemployed wife's new job as a medical assistant. He described all these things she did on her first day, like taking vitals from patients, using an ultrasound machine, hooking up and IV, seeing a patient's genitals and some other stuff that seemed way beyond her skill level and training something a person should not be doing on her first day and it set off alarm bells for me.\n\nI've been in a lot of medical facilities lately since I'm pregnant and about to pop and I like to chat up the people I interact with. I know a lot of the things my brother described involve certifications or multi year programs that my SIL has not done. So I expressed shock that the hospital would put an untrained person in such a patient forward position on her first day. I said I was uncomfortable with the idea of going to the hospital now if it was possible a person doing all this stuff for me was untrained like her. I also told him that going from never working more than part time to doing 12 hour shifts is very hard and instense. My husband said my tone of voice was super mean when I said this. \n\nI realized later that she and my brother were probably just overblowing her having a tour of the facilities. So by being shocked at this story not jibing with my experience with medical industry my husband said it came across like I was implying she was incompetent and a liar.

The next morning we got breakfast and he told me the loan is upwards of 150k. Apparently it\u2019s a consolidated loan between him and his two siblings. He went to a state college for 5 semesters and he said his debt is about 35k. His mother wants him and his siblings to split the loan into thirds which is how she calculated the amount per month they would pay. However, according to her calculations he would be paying 20k extra in loans that aren\u2019t even his. I implored him to speak with her as this could really cripple us financially. Yesterday he talked to her and she pretty much said that it is what it is. She claims there is no way to see how much he owes because the loan is consolidated\u2014 which I know is untrue.

People sitting near them looked visibly annoyed, but also sympathetic toward a disabled person.\nRecently, this same family started bringing an iPad and playing a movie for the guy in the wheelchair. With the sound on. Without earbuds. People sitting near them now get to hear all the sound from the movie along with the lecturer.

She claims that's emotional cheating because I was talking to this woman about things I didn't feel comfortable talking to my gf about, apparently I'm not allowed to talk to a friend every day, and this woman did not like my gf after they met once and so we decided it would be best if we hung out without my gf tagging along.

My parents covered almost everything, as was their plan from the start. During the RSVP/invite window, my mom jokingly gave me shit for not putting up a registry yet-- we had honestly forgotten about it, because we weren't really in need of any gifts and didn't expect anyone to do so. She said people would probably feel awkward if they didn't get us *anything,* especially since she and my dad were covering every cost (including lodging), so my wife and I sat down to discuss it. We agreed we'd make an Amazon wishlist for some household stuff that we didn't have and kind of wanted, but that didn't end up amounting to much-- but what we *did* actually want was a little more wiggle room on our honeymoon. I want to be clear here: the trip was paid for already, from our own money, but it was that we had cut a lot of corners to fit it into our budget that gave us the idea for the fund. It made enough sense to us; instead of giving us things we don't need, if you feel compelled, you can donate a comparable dollar amount to this account that will be spent on padding out our dream trip as a couple.\n\nWe went through with it and added the option to our RSVP/general wedding info site. Again, to be clear here: there was *no* expectation of gifts in the first place, monetary or otherwise, which we even said on the site. Simply that if someone did feel the need to give us a gift, and nothing on the wishlist sounded good, this was another thing they could do.\n\nThe wedding came and went and it was genuinely beautiful, everyone had a wonderful time and I couldn't have asked for things to go any better. No one had said anything about the fund or the registry at all; a few things had been purchased from the wishlist and a few donations had been made (all of which we were deeply grateful for and were prepared to write the *shit* out of some thank you cards), but it wasn't a topic of conversation.\n\nA few days later, though, we were shooting the shit with some extended family that had stayed on, and one of my aunts kind of blew up over the honeymoon fund. Ranting about how \"incredibly tacky\" it was and how embarrassed we should feel over even having it there, much less expecting anyone to donate. We were kind of blindsided already, and then a few cousins agreed that it was weird and kind of snobby of us, and that we should have just been \"normal\" and stuck to a physical registry even if we didn't need or want that stuff.\n\nThis isn't tearing our family apart and it's not that big a deal, but I'm really struggling to wrap my brain around it.

My SO is French and although amazing at English, is not fluent- that\u2019s why I was confused as to what he meant at first. I looked over my shoulder and saw that he was looking at a girl who was moving her things because the tide had come in.\n\n Thinking nothing of it, I nodded and continued enjoying my time in the water but couldn\u2019t help noticing that he continued to look at her. I said nothing until he mentioned the same girl again which then made me look over my shoulder and saw her now standing at the waters edge.\n\n I appreciate beautiful people, and she was definitely one- with a great body at that. But on the other hand, seeing my SO taken by a stranger was starting to make me feel inadequate and slowly become conscious of my body again.\n\n I stayed silent, not wanting my insecurity to get a hold of me but at this point he wasn\u2019t even looking- but blatantly staring.

While I was in medical school and graduate school these loans and interest were deferred while I finished my training. During this 15 year period after college, my dad had not mentioned a single thing about the loan to me.

Had I gone to a bank the loan would be far less due to refi.\n\nHe did not accept that excuse and held me to my contract.  My mother intervened a bit and he laid off.  I still gave him 11K in 2016 which was what my wife and I felt like we could do (we were paying for IVF at the time).  Then the situation was dropped. Didn't hear back again.\n\nSo now we are at present in 2019. I have a first job finally in my hometown (partly to be close to grandparents). My wife and I have a 3 year old toddler that spends time with my mom and dad and she loves it and they love her. The galaxy was at peace.\n\nI get another text message from my dad asking to pay off the loan.  I meet him in person and remind him that I don\u2019t feel like the loan terms were good and offer to pay about half, **basically to 20K** like I would have paid a bank.\n\nNow my wife and I make decent money. We are in the 90th percentile for household salary. But paying over 30K to my dad was not in the cards. At this point I'm feeling pretty angry now since I thought we had settled a lot of this. My parents are not hard up for money. They both have good pensions, own a Hawaiian condo where they winter for a couple of months. Complicating the matter was that my older brother essentially had the same loan from him and paid it off with those bonkers terms.\n\nLater this evening I get a text from Dad basically threatening to disown me and never talk to me if I don\u2019t pay him back over the 45k.  I expect him serious.  Part of me, like him is stubborn, and I'm willing to burn this relationship down. He's 70 now and I think he'll need me more than I'll need him.  My mother knows nothing of this so far.\n\nAITA for not agreeing to his loan terms?\n\n**Edit:** posters had suggested that I put in where the money originally came from. My father took a home equity loan two years prior to issuing the loan to me (probably to help my brother finish college). He took 75K out from what I know, about 16K was used to pay for my schooling. From what I know the loan was closed in 2013", "Let me explain. The other day, I took the bus to work and all seats beside the priority ones were full (no one were standing) so I sat in one of them and put on my headphones. I kept an eye alert in case someone who actually needed the priority seat got on the bus. And at some point, a man approached me very bluntly and raising his voice \"are you pregnant?\". I looked at him and answer no and then he said I should give him the seat then. I looked at him in disbelief \"you don't have to yell at me\". I was willing to give him my seat even if he doesn't seem like he needed because I'm aware some disabilities are not easy to see. But his answer was \"I'm autistic\" looking at me as if that was reason enough for me to jump out of the seat and justify his behavior.\n\nI know that for some people with autism is difficult to modulate the voice tone to the situation but I also feel he was being openly rude. I don't think being autistic mean you get the priority seat over a neurotypical person. I might be wrong so AITA?", "As you may or may not know, Instagram sends a  notification every time someone \u201cunsends\u201d a message to someone else. My friend, who has anxiety, has a habit of sending long fragmented messages and if she doesn\u2019t receive a response within a few minutes, she unsends every single message because of her anxiety. This means that I (and the other people she texts) also receive individual notifications for every message that has been unsent. I had a feeling that she wasn\u2019t aware of this as I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea that she would want to bring more attention to herself if she\u2019s scared that she\u2019s been ignored, so I asked her if she was aware that this happened, and now her anxiety has heightened and she\u2019s blaming me for not letting her be ignorant since she\u2019s now realised the hundreds of notifications people must get from her unsending messages. I didn\u2019t want her to find out in a way that would hurt her, such as someone getting irritated by her habit, but now I\u2019m wondering if I should\u2019ve let her stay blissfully ignorant?", "Seems pretty obvious to me but I am getting a lot of shit from people at my work right now. Work at a hospital as a resident doctor. One of the nursing assistants left a half eaten plate of food in the nursing pod. I get in in the morning and it\u2019s sitting out, was covered by another plate but still disgusting since it\u2019s out where patients walk by and I threw it away. My coresidents gave me a hard time about it saying I shouldn\u2019t throw things away without asking and even one of the medical students said something like wth? There is a staff lounge where people eat and it is literally right around the corner and is a designated area for people to eat. If you don\u2019t want your half eaten food thrown away don\u2019t leave it out in the middle of a patient floor at the hospital. AITA?\n\nEdit: No judgements toward nursing assistants but to everyone saying I\u2019m the asshole for throwing away a nurses food, this was not a nurse. They have downtime throughout their shift, especially overnight, they have scheduled breaks in which the other nursing assistants cover if someone needs vitals taken right away. The nurses at our hospital will set up at a computer , typically can tell and I\u2019m not going around with a JAHCO checklist policing the hospital; honestly don\u2019t care. This food stank, was out in the middle table where no one keeps personal food items and appeared to be old.", "So a bit of backstory, I play piano at the markets in my town, and make a bit of money off it too, in order to pay for my piano lessons. There's this chick who I met a few years ago (I'll name her M), although never talked to because she was one of those typical kids who were 'too kool for everything' and just an overall dick. anyway, This year, she's randomly been talking to me a whole bunch, and I've been responding with my general enthusiasm to be polite, although I never really liked her. After a while, she started to become a sort of tolerable person, and I'd almost consider her a friend. (Friends in my eyes are much more than most people consider them to be, So naturally I don't have many) Anyway, one day, I was sitting in English, and a mate of mine was asking how much I make from busking piano. I told him, and then M randomly pipes up, and says \"Can you fundraise for me?\". I asked her what for, and she said \"Family members of mine from \\*CountryName\\* had to sell all of their belongings and are having to sleep on the ground with no food, water or anything and are dying! Can you fundraise one day for me? I can pay you! $100 here is like $100,000 in their country!\"From this, My initial thought was: Firstly, I don't think that's how money works. It may be a larger value, but it's still proportionally the same money, secondly, I've never ever heard of the country she stated and thirdly, What do you mean you'll pay me? if you can pay me for it, then why not just send them money yourself? anyway, I tried my best to very politely skirt around it, Making perfectly valid reasons as to why I couldn't, but she kept going at it. I then again, politely dismissed it. She then said \"What's up with you always saying no to things?\" And I felt really bad after saying that, but kept to my point, and told her it's not happening. The next part caught me really off guard... She said -And I quote- \"Fine, Don't think about the dying person then!\" At this point I didn't know what to say... I just sorta sat there, Jaw dropped like those typical movie clich\u00e9s.. I eventually turned away and dismissed myself from the conversation, as she said \"Wait I was joking\"I can't help but feel really bad, but at the same time, I personally don't think she was telling the truth, and -given her history- thought she was just looking for money to use for a specific malicious intention, But thinking that makes me feel even worse! Am I the bad guy here?", "Saturdaymorning, kids (2yo and 7yo) wake up, I ask hubby to take morning shift with the kids as I took last weekend. He gets out of bed, grabs his covers and pillow. His intentions are to feed the kids then sleep in the sofa. We have talked about this often and I do not feel the kids are safe this way or the house. He said we should agree too disagree and He should be able to sleep in the sofa during his morning shifts,that he has made a habbit of it.  \nI just feel he does this to get out of his morning shift as he knows I can not sleep when he does this.  \nSo right now He is sleeping in the bed and I am furious and in need of judgement.  \nAm I the asshole for demanding he stay awake and keep our kids safe during his morning shift?", "So, I was at my cousins (7) Birthday Party and we got up to the pinata. There was about 20 kids hitting the pinata and I was no. 20 since I am the eldest (15) at the time. When it was my turn the pinata was pretty banged up. So i picked up the stick and hit with all my might. Which was quite alot since I played baseball for school.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it broke and my cousin started crying since he didn't get to smash it. Then i got berated by his mum for not forgoing my turn just so he could hit it. Which i thought was pretty unfair.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "My mother is remarried to a guy that my brother, sister and I don't like. She's known how we feel about him pretty much their entire relationship. My brother has a 2 year old, a 6 month old, my sister has 1.5 year old twins, and I have a 1 year old. We refer to this guy by his name only, and make sure to correct ANYONE who thinks he's our father. \n\nRecently he asked if it bothers us that he calls all our children his grandchildren and we all said yes. Yet he claims that since he's been around for 20 years we should just get over it. Hell post on social media saying it, he'll send text messages saying it, and when I had my baby he was so quick to tell the nurse that he is such a proud grandfather. Even in front of my father in law who is a legit grand father. \n\nAre we the asshole?\n\nEdit: a lot of people asked for more details so here's goes. Btw I very much appreciate everyone's feedback here\n\n1) it's not just my brother, sister and I who hate him. Everyone dislikes this guy. My uncle(mom's brother), my father hated him, cousins and other family members. Even people.who barely interact with him grew to dislike him only after a few interactions. \n\n2) there's a very long history here (20 years worth) of reasons why we don't like him. He makes up stories, telling multiple people the same story with the details never matching. Never holds a job for longer than 6 months to a year. Even my wife who tries to see the good in everyone said recently that it hit her how many jobs he's held since her and I met (10 years). \n\n3) my mother and father were very civil and friend when they separated. They coparented as best they could. Then this guy got involved and began to put his two cents into their parenting and this caused a lot of friction. \n\n4) my father sadly passed away 2 years ago. He was only 56. My brother had his daughter roughly 6 months before my father passed. And with my father being sick and unable to be around his granddaughter, my step father would post on social media at every opportunity referring to himself as a grandfather. My brother asked him to stop because he felt it was disrespectful to our actual father. So he stopped until that December (3 months after my dad passed) when my sister had her babies and started immediately posting about how he's a proud grandfather to 3 beautiful grandchildren. So we had to tell him again. Then almost 9 months later I had my baby and AGAIN he started posting about himself as a proud grandfather to 4 perfect grandbabies. \n\n5) he has a daughter who has a baby of her own. No relationship there. He hasn't tried to have a relationship with her since maybe 2 years after I met him. He acts like she doesn't even exist. \n\n6) us not liking him isn't a new thing. Before my mother and him got married my mother asked my brother, sister and I how we felt about him separately. We all said we didn't like him and didn't trust him. That was over 15 years ago. And there have been many convos and arguments over the years where we've made it clear. \n\nI can go into much more detail but I think that covers a lot of what is being asked. Please feel free to ask me for any other details.\n\nEDIT #2 - it seems like I need to explain further what our problem is. Our request is that he ease up on constantly posting to social media with captions saying \"my grandchildren\" or \"proud grandparent\". We've all explained that our father, their real grandfather is not with us and cannot post any pictures with them. We all feel like it's very disrespectful to him to do that. We'd prefer he never called them his grandkids, but in person we can't stop him from doing whatever he wants. There are reasons we don't want him to be around our kids that much. \n\n1) he had to be told numerous times not to pull his paper towel out of his pocket and wipe out kids faces with it. \n2) he had to be told multiple times not to put his fingers in our kids mouths. \n3) we've all asked him not to bring our kids into other rooms and out of our site. \n4) he has an addiction to pain meds and we never know when he's high from them\n5) he falls asleep in the middle of the day on the couch and would absolutely fall asleep with them in his lap or just fall asleep and let them roam unattended\n6) he's not a hygenic person and we just don't feel comfortable with them around him\n7) there was an incident recently where he was watching my sister's kids with my mother and my sister has a camera so she can check in here and there. She got a notification of movement and the video shows him very creepily staring at the camera, he pretends to move the board games stacked next to the camera around, here's my mother coming back from putting the babies to bed and sits down, when she steps out of the room again he quickly gets up and turns the camera. The camera stayed that way until about 15 minutes before my sister and her husband were getting back home.", "For a little context: my group of friends is pretty tight knit and have known each other forever. All of us share a common love of cooking, grow food in our gardens, brew our own beer/kombucha, and like to experiment with ingredients. \n\nOne of my friends recently hosted an end of summer potluck and all of the usual suspects were there. Everyone made something and most people\u2019s dishes included something they had grown themselves or was a new dish they were experimenting with. My partner and I made some granola bars that used berries from our garden, whole nuts, homemade granola, etc... they looked like normal granola bars. But one of the ingredients that was \u201cinvisible\u201d was cricket flower that we used for additional protein and binder for all the other ingredients. It\u2019s important to note that cricket flower is literally just dehydrated crickets that have been ground into a fine powder, so it would be impossible to know what it was just by looking at it. \n\nWe put them out on the table with everyone else\u2019s stuff, and later in the day someone asked who brought the bars bc they liked them. We got talking about how we made them, which is pretty common conversation with this group, and I mentioned that one of the ingredients was cricket flower and he made a huge deal about it, saying how gross it is and that is was messed up that I would feed people bugs without telling them what it was. A lot of the other people at the party were pretty grossed out by it too, even tho many of them had already eaten and enjoyed them. I know everyone that was there fairly well and I know their dietary restrictions seeing as we cook for each other all the time. \n\nI feel bad bc yeah, it is an unusual ingredient and some people might find it gross, but I wouldn\u2019t have mentioned anything ahead of time if I had used some other unusual seed or spice (and neither would anyone else in this group). I guess bc this was an insect a lot of people are telling me that it\u2019s different and I should have told everyone ahead of time what was in the bars. Am I the asshole here?", "[deleted]", "EDIT: I removed the word \"sullen\" from my description of my wife's demeanor, I didn't realize it has negative connotations. I was not trying to say that my wife was acting moody or childish or to be dismissive of or insulting to her.\n\nRestoring classic cars has been my hobby for the last 15 years. My wife has always been fine with this, but she's never been interested in cars herself, which she told me pretty early on when we started dating. This was the same conversation where she told me about her deceased brother, who had died about 2 years before we met. Here's basically how the conversation went:\n\nMe: I'm into cars, are you?\n\nHer: Not really. My brother was really into cars when I was growing up, though.\n\nMe: You'll have to introduce us sometime.\n\nHer: He died a couple of years ago. But he was an army mechanic, that's how much he was into cars.\n\nShe clearly didn't want to talk about her dead brother, so I didn't ask her any more about him. This whole time (8 years now) I've assumed that he died in the army and my wife has never volunteered any details about his death.\n\nSo fast forward to this weekend, I picked up a car at an auction that I've been trying to get my hands on for a long time. I don't want to give myself away, but it's the equivalent of a \"rare collectible\" and I have the potential to make a LOT of money restoring and selling this car.\n\nMy wife didn't see the car until I had brought it home and it was sitting in our driveway. We have an established budget for my hobby so I don't run purchases by her beyond that, which she's fine with. But when she got home and saw this car, she broke down crying and told me for the first time that her brother died in a car accident in the exact same make/model of car.\n\nShe hasn't asked me to give up the car, but I can tell she would like me to. Usually I work in our driveway but I've been hiding this car in the garage the last couple of days so she doesn't have to see it as much, but she's still ~~kind of sullen and~~ obviously upset when I come in from working.\n\nMy plan is to just finish restoring the car and then sell it asap. But my buddy told me that I'm being an asshole and I should just scrap the project, is he right?", "Throwaway, mostly bc my main account is very recognizable and my SO could easily figure out its me. Also please excuse length and formatting. I\u2019m on mobile AND I\u2019m bad at summarizing lmao.\n\n\nI am in a LDR with my SO. He lives in the US, I live in a non English speaking European country. Specific, I know, but it\u2019s important.\nWe have been together for more than 5 years, and I just know he\u2019s the one. \n\nSadly. where he lives he\u2019s unable to afford university and find a job that he has a vocation for (sciences). Instead he\u2019s forced to do a very labor intensive job that doesn\u2019t pay well and leaves him exhausted and frustrated.For this reason, and many other (among which me absolutely refusing to move to the US) he plans on moving here with a student visa next year. No problems, my family is more than happy to help him, and I\u2019m teaching him the language. I 100% plan on marrying this guy and being with him till I kick the bucket.\nSince we are very open and, not to brag, have great communication, we\u2019ve already discussed things such as family and possible children.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the problem. He insists on giving his own name to a possible future son. He argues that it\u2019s a family tradition (his father has the same name as well) and is very vocal about it. So far I have only stated that it\u2019ll be a discussion for later as we\u2019re both still young and I don\u2019t plan on having kids for a few years still. \nBut the truth is, I HATE the idea. Not because I don\u2019t like his name, but because\n\n1: it would feel so incredibly awkward to call my child the same name I cry out during intimate moments. I felt the exact same way when I found out he has the same name as his dad, but it\u2019s not like I can complain about that. \n\n2: this name is English, and not only that, it\u2019s a weird one at that. I live in a non English speaking country, and children with foreign names here are known to be ridiculed and bullied. Having been bullied most of my school life for many reasons, I know what it feels like and want to avoid it at all costs for my future kids. \n\n3: lastly, this name would curse him to a life of \u201chuh?\u201d, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name again?\u201d And several butchering. I know because I have a fairly weird name myself, it\u2019s in my language but it\u2019s very rare and I\u2019ve gone through my life constantly being asked about it or bullied about it (see point 2) and it\u2019s very annoying.\n\nIt\u2019s not a problem yet but I already feel like TA for being so viscerally against this.\n\nSo tell me reddit, AITA?", "A little background here:  Me and my wife have been separated for almost two months now and expect to be divorced in the next month or two.  She works from home doing in-home daycare and watches two kids that go to school with our kids.  Because she doesn't drive and I don't mind, I drop-off and pickup the kids from school every day.  This includes the two that she provides after-school daycare for.\n\nOne of the parents messaged my wife today and told her that they were going to be busy on Monday and  wouldn't be there to pickup their children.  They had a sitter lined up at their house starting at 5PM (when my wife's daycare ends) and wanted to know if I wouldn't mind driving their kids home because the sitter is only 16 years old and isn't very comfortable driving yet.  My wife said yes on my behalf and only told me about it afterwards.\n\nI work from home and am allowed two 15 minute breaks a day, which I already use to pickup kids at 11AM and 3PM.  So I would have to clear it with my boss to take another break to take home two kids that aren't my responsibility.  Honestly, it's not that it's that big of an inconvenience but I'm afraid if I don't set boundaries now then she will continue to try and use me as her shuttle.\n\nI went ahead and told her she should have consulted me beforehand because the answer is no and she says she didn't ask me because it's a 'no-brainer' and by saying no I'd only hurt my own reputation in town.\n\nSo, AITA here?", "In my home town, there's one dedicated group for Dungeons and Dragons for teenagers. I, (16 M), joined a running campaign. The campaign was extremely serious and grim dark. I created a human bard who's a big nerd for music theory who's overly friendly, but also quick to anger. I have a nasty habit of getting caught in the moment and saying stupid shit. That cultivated to a head when we were fighting the BBEG and I called it a 'big dumb shit face' using Vicious Mockery (A spell where you insult a foe and it hurts) and it kills. Me and one other guy out of a group of eight are the only ones laughing. \n\nWe'll call the guy who laughed 'Chris'. He becomes important later. Both Chris and I and friends with the DM. Throughout the campaign I did a few, kind of minor jokey things. The DM pulls me aside and is like, 'you fucker, this was my big moment and you made a stupid joke.' Keep in mind, we are all awkward and hormonal teenagers.\n\nDespite what I felt, at the time, triumphant, I now felt like shit. I apologized, I took my stuff and left. I actually in retrospect feel bad. Later the DM sends me a strawpoll over Discord showing the majority of the group decided to kick me. One voted not to kick me. Obviously I'm angry, but it's not like I didn't expect it. I send a good bye message to the group. I kinda get ghosted by the group, which made me feel worse. I was a mess for a bit because I felt like an idiot and was confused, but then I decided to stop pitying myself and resolved to make my own campaign with my own players, one that wasn't as grim dark, one that was serious but also had a lot of room for comedy and jokes. I create a world and invite five people who were not involved with the previous campaign and to my surprise, everyone joins. This is where it gets bad.\n\nI run session zero and hey, these new players are pretty good, they roleplay and interact. On the cusp of starting the actual first session, Chris wants to join my campaign. I asked him like 'Hey, aren't you still apart of DM's campaign?\" He was like, \"Yeah\"... in something I probably shouldn't of done in retrospect. I said yes. New group mates love Chris and his char. This is when things went from bad to worse. \n\nI receive a message from old DM and he is *furious*. He said that I was so shit at Dungeons and Dragons that I needed to steal his players to have any chance. Apparently Chris jokingly shit-talked old DM's campaign and gave old DM the heads up that he was leaving to join mine. \n\nNow, supposedly, over Discord messages between Chris and old DM, they argued over me and now hate each other and I'm being used as the arguing point. By connection to Chris, old DM hates me too. One of the members of the old group sends me a message saying if I hadn't made a new campaign, no one would be arguing and that we'd all still be friends and that this is my fault... which still doesn't add up because they ghosted me after I was kicked so I'm not sure most of those guys were even my friends. \n\nAITA?", "I think I'm not TA but people got triggered when I told them so I'm questioning if I am. \n\nI have this one lady who works at my school, and I dont even know what she does.

But apparently im just \"overreacting\" and being \"rude for no reason\".", "This has been bothering me for a while, so I figured I\u2019d post it here and get the clarity I need. I am a support worker for autistic kids, and have been working with my current family for about 7 months. This family is very dysfunctional, mom is not in the picture and the kids are aged 4-8. Most workers drop the family after a month or so due to the screaming and fights, it isn\u2019t the nicest looking place either. \n\nI\u2019m employed through a nonprofit that in turn gets funding through the state, the child\u2019s father is not my employer. I am there to watch one child, the oldest, yet I do little favors to help out the other kids. I can\u2019t say no to them when things are already so rough at home. Anyways, about a month ago the other support worker freaked out, cursed out the dad, and suddenly used her 2 weeks vacation time to leave. I ended up picking up the slack and went from 3 days to 5-6. \n\nThen I was also watching the second oldest child for a few weeks. Dad offered me money in exchange for watching her but honestly I wasn\u2019t going to take 10 bucks from a man who clearly needed it more than I did so I refused. Next day dad asks me to go to the store with the oldest and grab milk, he gives me a WIC card (government assistance). We go to the store and I don\u2019t realize you can\u2019t use WIC at self checkout, I\u2019m socially awkward, so I pay the 3 dollars for the milk and we head home. I tell them the situation and that I had to pay with my own money. He says, \u201cOh. Thank you. I don\u2019t have any money right now.\u201d I just say okay and head out for the night, it was the end of my shift anyways. \n\nNext day is Saturday and he had plans to take the kids out to the lake. I told him I couldn\u2019t go, and he freaked out about me being a huge part in going and I was needed. I told him that I didn\u2019t have the 40 dollars to fill my car up with gas to go to the lake. My job reimburses me mileage but not immediately. It wasn\u2019t even that I did not have the money, I was just mad that he offered me 10 dollars for watching his kid, then next day he doesn\u2019t have 3 dollars for milk, then day after he has the money for gas and snacks for the kids to go to the lake? After working 2x as many hours and refusing his money for watching the kids multiple times, buying them food, taking them out, the one time I asked for compensation he did not have it. I felt taken advantage of. I found out from his girlfriend later that they never even went to the lake that day due to not being able to afford it. So why did he yell at me for \u201cruining his kid\u2019s day?\u201d I had been working extra days, and he had the day off so it\u2019s not like they were needing someone to be there. I do feel bad for not being there to entertain the kids though. AITA for bailing on my autistic client and his siblings?\n\nTL;DR: Dad is on hard times, I work extra and beyond my job description to help out. The one time I ask for compensation he refuses, only to yell at me for not showing up/wanting to spend my personal money to take his kids to the lake the next day?", "Good Afternoon everyone,\n\nI suppose this is more of an ethical question than a legal inquiry, but wanted to explain my family's situation and see if I can please get everyone's thoughts on the matter.\n\n My sister was arrested for her third DUI last night in Fairfax, VA.  Her first DUI was in Montgomery County, MD, second was in Philadelphia, PA.  I do not know the exact details of each case as I live in a different area of the country, but she miraculously still held a valid driver's license and served very minimal jail time (one year) for each.  My understanding is that her license has been revoked by the State of Virginia at this time.\n\nVirginia basically takes no shit for DUI's and I imagine she will be serving some serious prison time.  My mother and father depleted their joint bank account on attorney fees, restitution to the city (damage to a city gate and light pole), short-term rehab stints, and therapy for my sister, but this is the last straw.  I DO have the money to pay for attorney fees, but feel that she is beyond help at this point.  She will not get help or listen to reason.  She blames everyone else for her problems.\n\nAt the end of the day, my parents have faith in her recovery and have been begging me to pay for my sister's legal fees which will no doubt be out of this world.  They've been calling, texting, and e-mailing me non-stop -- her boyfriend has been calling me and guilt tripping me as well.  Even her co-workers have been trying to contact me to which I finally turned off my phone and .. here I am.\n\nMy sister is not a bad person, I promise.  She is addicted to alcohol.  I love her dearly, but am very angry with her for essentially deterring my parents from retiring and putting such a financial strain on them in their golden years.  She also could have seriously injured or KILLED someone not once, twice, but THREE times.  On the flip side, I feel I will be turning my back on her if I don't help her out - they say family is everything.\n\nI'm very sorry to vent, I am just very frustrated and conflicted.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "Whenever I go to a restaurant I usually end up ordering from the kid's menu\nI do this mainly for two reasons. I Am a really picky eater and the kid's menu usually has some sort of food that I'm used to and I like that. The second reason is the kid's menu is almost always cheaper than the adult one and it's usually easier to prepare too. The reason why I'm asking this is that I was at a restaurant this morning with my family and I ended up ordering several meals from the kid's menu. The waiter apparently did not like this because she looked me up and down, glared at me and asked me if I was sure I didn't want my food from the adult menu.

I tore the page out from the opposite corner of the spit, along with the page after it because it looked like it soaked through.\n\nShe got offended about me taking the notebook away from her and \"making a big deal out of nothing\" because she \"just wanted some paper\". I don't think it's making a big deal, and personally feel that \"I will not allow you to rub your saliva on my belongings for any reason\" is a fine boundary to set. \n\nSo, AITA for taking my notebook out of her hands for licking her fingers enough to make two pages damp?", "[removed]", "My parents have a flight at 5:30, so they want to get there at 4:30 AM.

I was attracted to her the instant I met her, but I had the good sense to not go head over heels over essentially nothing. There are plenty more girls on campus, and she gave me no indication that she liked me, so I decided On being friends with her completely platonically. So, we became really good friends. We texted almost everyday over the summer, despite being hours apart. She said a few things that made me feel like she wanted a relationship and things become more apparent that she wanted to be more than friends when we got back on campus. Eventually, I received enough green lights to just ask her out. It became evident very shortly that she didn\u2019t feel the same way about me. As soon as it became clear to her I wasn\u2019t joking about a date, she started tweaking out. She told me she\u2019s going through a lot of drama with her friend group and doesn\u2019t really feel like she has anyone to turn to but me. I knew about the drama, but I never knew I was that important to her. She told me she saw me only as her closest friend and expressed that she was scared we would stop talking. She kept saying it was shitty of her to not make it clear that she didn\u2019t want to date me. \n\nBasically, I told her that 1) she wasn\u2019t a bad person for not wanting to date me 2) she didn\u2019t explicitly lead me on and it was really just me misinterpreting our relationship which is no one\u2019s fault and 3) id still be friends with her and that it\u2019d be shitty of me to leave her based solely on her rejecting me.\n\nA few days pass on and she texted me to tell me that she felt like her fears were coming true, as I texted her /asked her to hang out much less frequently. She basically wanted to know if this was me \u201crecovering\u201d from the breakup or a permanent thing. I told her honestly that this would be a permanent thing. When we were in what I perceived to be in a weird limbo between friendship and dating, it\u2019s only natural that I was gonna invest more time into her, more so than I would with my own friends.

I tried to form a response but she hung up and won\u2019t pick up or respond to any texts. It\u2019s obvious that she\u2019s been going through more than she let on about her personal life and I feel really bad about basically leaving her all alone in a time like this, but I honestly don\u2019t think I did anything wrong.\n\nSo did I fuck up?", "My boyfriend (21M) and I (21F) live together and are both in college.

Being a little tight on money I asked him to split the grocery bill 75/25 since I\u2019m not home as often and I don\u2019t eat as much as him anyways. He thinks it was a ridiculous thing to ask, as it\u2019s my fault I don\u2019t eat that much and that I\u2019m not home to eat it.

I was under impression that they were both with men for over 2 months, but she corrected me last week, and told me they were with women. She always used gender neutral expressions, but I always referred to her exes using male pronouns, and she never corrected me.

However, she clearly doesn\u2019t want a wedding at all and is just going through the motions for me. She was really quiet when we were visiting venues and I ended up just picking one myself. She hasn\u2019t been involved in anything else about the wedding, which is frustrating because I wanted to share that experience with her but our families and I are handling it. I\u2019ve been telling people that she\u2019s too busy at work to get involved. I asked her if she really wants to get married and she said she does but wants to elope.\n\nShe\u2019s clearly going to hate this wedding and she gets sad and distant and a little passive aggressive when I talk to her about stuff like my bachelor party (the bridesmaids are relatives she isn't close to). I want to give up sometimes but I think about standing at the alter with her and making those memories with my family and friends and it\u2019s worth it.

We\u2019ve been together a few years, and have talked very seriously about our future, he\u2019s even talked in certain terms about getting married next year, but he was adamant about buying the house prior to anything marriage related. \n\nHe was the one to buy the house (I am not on the deed, I pay him rent) as I don\u2019t want to buy property with someone I\u2019m not married to. We\u2019d already lived together for a year and a half or so before moving into a house. \n\nI know he\u2019s been gearing up to propose (my mom accidentally spilled the beans when he came to ask her permission... \ud83d\ude2c) but I haven\u2019t said anything to him, I know he\u2019s trying to make it a surprise and he wants it to be special. \n\nLast night I was looking for something and he told me to check his office, specifically a couple sets of drawers. I went up to check and in plain sight in one drawer, was a ring box. I opened it but as soon as I realized what was going on I immediately shut it and felt terrible. \n\nI went back to him and he asked if I found what I was looking for and I said \u201chey, you should be careful telling me to look in those drawers, there might be something people aren\u2019t supposed to find in there\u201d and he gave me an odd look and then it clicks into place and he carefully asks \u201cwell how did you feel?\u201d And I said \u201chappy and excited of course!\u201d And he starts smiling and is like \u201cwell you\u2019re just gonna have to wait!\u201d And laughs. \n\nI let it go after that, since I then felt bad for even mentioning it but since he\u2019d sent me to that drawer specifically I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it. He claims he forgot it was in that drawer and I should just \u201cforget about it\u201d... but it\u2019s tough. \n\nHe knows how important this commitment is to me, and he\u2019s continued to talk about our wedding next year as if it\u2019s a given it will happen.

I\u2019m really tired of waiting around. The convo with my mom happened almost a month ago. A couple months ago when the wedding topic came up, I kind of gently was like \u201chey, I\u2019m excited too, but just know, I\u2019m not making any plans or arrangements because you haven\u2019t asked yet\u201d and he said he understood and just to hold tight because it would be \u201csoon, very soon\u201d. \n\nAnd meanwhile I\u2019ve made the commitment to move with him to this new city.

I\u2019m pretty sure I am TA, and I need to take a chill pill, but I\u2019m so sick of waiting.

For a long time it was just my SO and I parking on the street in front of our house. We ended up getting neighbors on both sides of us that can't parallel park.

Now each neighbor had plenty of room to park and one of us was still in front of our house. \n\nRecently our right side neighbor has started to park further up so that there is enough room for me and my SO, we just have to parallel park (which neither of us have a problem with).\n\nOne night I was already at home and my SO was lined up to start parallel parking behind me. Our left side neighbor arrived home just seconds after him, pulled up next to him and said \"you can't park there\". My SO pulled up and parked down the street and the neighbor circled the block and parked in front of their house. My SO got out and asked them why he couldn't park there and she responded \"well it's in front of our house\". My SO responded that it is a public street, he can park where ever, and he would have been in front of our house but the left side neighbor would have had to parallel park. They admitted that they can't parallel park but that we should park further up so that they have enough room in front of their house to park. \n\nMy SO told me all of this and I got very upset because we had been trying to help them and now they are telling us where we can and can't park. I decided to start parking right on the fence line between our yards. This meant that I parked inches away from her a couple times but she still had half a car length behind her so she could get out. \n\nShe started parking more and more past the fence line in front of our house and I continued to park right on top of her. One day she got pissed and after I went back to work after lunch I saw her on our security camera come out, complain to our other neighbor about how close I was, get in her car and move it even further in front of our house despite having a full car length behind her. When we got home my SO parked in front of her and I parked behind her pinning her in for the weekend.\n\nIt looks like she called her parents to get her out and parked down the street. My SO and I had the opportunity to keep her spot blocked but decided to open it up and give her the chance to start parking in front of her house again. \n\nI watched her on our camera move her car to her spot and park on her side of the fence. She got out of the car,  saw that we would have room to park in front of her, got back in her car and moved in front of our house again. \n\nAITA for pinning her in? WIBTA if I went to her house and told her that she made the rules of not parking in front of each other's houses. She needs to follow them.\n\n\nUpdate: After having her pinned in for the weekend we decided to wave the white flag and opened the spots back up. Monday she parked in front of her house, and even though there was plenty of room for both my SO and I to park in front of our house my SO parked down the street and I parked in front of our house so the neighbor would have plenty of room to get out.\nWe assumed everything was back to normal.\nToday she parked in front of her house and her boyfriend, who usually parks in their parking spot behind their house, is parked in front of our house. There is just enough space between their cars and surrounding cars that you can't quite park in between them. \nSo now my SO gets to park down the street in front of the abandoned house and I get to find a spot around the block.", "I'm a pretty private person and as a rule don't kiss and tell, but recently I made an exception to this rule and pretty much every queer friend I have in my life is split on if I did right or wrong.\n\nThere is this guy (lets call him John) who I met a while back during a party a mutual friend of us were holding. We hit it off but actually didn't immediately hook up and instead developed a friendship which soon turned into a FWB situation. I was pretty surprised when he came onto me given he seemed so straight laced, but I was pretty open to it and let him keep it on the down low out of respect for where he was on his journey. Eventually John ended up moving when he graduated and our relationship ended there, but thing were still amenable and we talk from time to time.\n\nRecently I found John deep in the comment section of a relatives of his comment section, debating against the normalization of gay relationships and gay adoption. I was pretty shocked by this and pretty much immediately sent him a private message asking why he was arguing against queer rights when he himself was queer. Rather than respond normally he just responded with \"?\". Literally just that. Then continued on with his hateful point of view right after.\n\nI admit I got a little wound up over that and after I saw him post more hate right after sending me that, I publicly asked him why he was against queer people and queer relationships when he himself engaged in them and linked something about self hating homosexuals. Pretty much immediately things blew up, I got a ton of furious messages from him and a bunch of people took notice and it's apparently gotten really big. He blocked me then unblocked me to send a tirade at me asking me what the fuck I thought I was doing making up these lies (another thing that just blew my mind) and telling me I was fucked in the head. I also got a ton of messages from mutual friends of ours asking if this was true and asking me to spill the beans.\n\nI thought I was in the right and was pretty resolute in that but the mixed reaction I've got from my friends has me wondering if I was too harsh.

They also had large TVs where you could watch the Turkish League soccer matches...which is still odd for me but whatever.  Its a total switch from the boring routine of chow hall food I get everyday.\n\nWe place an order for drinks.  When the server returns with our drinks, my gf is leaning back on the couch with a cigarette in hand. She says something to the server...then he moves the salt and pepper shakers from the middle of the table so they are directly in front of her!

Katie and I live about 1.5 hours from each other- I live in a big city, she doesn\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been a huge fan of Ryan, but he\u2019s not my partner so... eh. He works in sales and is often out of town, including some weekends. Chelsea doesn\u2019t have facebook and is only occasionally on instagram. \n\nChelsea came into the office last Monday declaring she had the GREATEST WEEKEND EVER and met a new guy. She was gushing. She basically told a group of us how she spent the weekend with him. She told me his name was Ryan and he was from a town about three hours away, but I didn\u2019t think much of it \u2014 it\u2019s a common name, after all! Plus, Katie\u2019s Ryan lives only 1.5 hours away, and I have no idea of his work schedule. \n\nFinally, someone said they needed to see a picture of \u201cHunky Ryan.\u201d She pulls up a string of 5-10 selfies \u2014 SO NOT CHELSEA LIKE \u2014 and to my surprise, the guy was The. Ryan. I asked Chelsea to go out for post-work drinks and spilled that Ryan is my childhood friend Katie\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and they\u2019re set to get married next month. Chelsea was understandably upset, but encouraged me to tell Katie. Unbeknownst to me, Chelsea\u2019s high school/college sweetheart cheated on her as soon as they graduated from college half a decade ago. She was Team Fuck Ryan. Chelsea offered to speak to Katie, if Kate wanted. Chelsea told me that in their time together, Ryan talked about prior recent hookups, though she has no information of if those are true accounts or not. \n\nI told Katie and it was... hard. To say the least. For Katie more so of course. I gave Katie Chelsea\u2019s number. Katie never reached out, which is fine.\n\nFast forward to this week. I got a long email yesterday morning from Katie saying that she knows Ryan has always struggled with commitment (?) and she believes he had cold feet, which led to an \u201cunfortunate mistake\u201d that they \u201cwish to put behind them as they prepare for marriage.\u201d\n\nI feel uncomfortable standing up in a wedding where the groom was recently so cruel to his fianc\u00e9.

It turned out they were the prospective buyers of the house next door. They explained they were in my driveway/sideyard because they were looking at the neighbor's fence and trying to ascertain if metal fences were allowed.\n\nOne of the first things the prospective buyer's wife said was that it may not work out because the house needs a new roof. I said that a lot of homes in the area have been getting new roofs lately and we just had ours replaced 4-5 years ago.\n\nMonday I get a knock on the door and it's the sellers (husband and wife both). He asked if I'd met them and I said that I had. He then claimed they were trying to back out of the contract because I told them the house needs a new roof. I explained to him that I didn't say that and I know nothing about his roof so I wouldn't ever make a comment about the life of his roof.\n\nHe said that he had 3 people tell him that I said his house needs a new roof and I told him that I don\u2019t care how many people he had tell him that because a lie is a lie no matter how many people he hears the lie from.\n\nThis went in a circular fashion maybe 3 times with him accusing me, my telling him that it was untrue, him claiming that 3 people told him I said that, and my telling him that I don\u2019t care how many people said that. It might have continued longer except my wife got irritated and came to the door and loudly stated, \u201cWhy would he EVER try to ruin your house sale when WE WANT YOU TO MOVE?\u201d\n\nAt that point he started yelling about it and then walked away shouting about how I better never set foot on his property again. (I had met a person on his lawn a week prior while he was away on vacation and talked to them long enough to ascertain it was his real-estate agent. I thought I was doing something nice by keeping an eye on his place while it was for sale but the way the real estate agent tells it I was all over his property--it was maybe 15' in reality.)\n\nAfter checking my security footage I discovered that I actually have video of the buyers in my driveway telling me that the house needs a new roof. Since he asked me not to step on his property I tried texting the proof to him and since I got no response I parked my car in front of his place with a screenshot of the video taped to the window along with a note that said \u201cI even got the conversation on video. Asshole.\u201d\n\nThe next day (I\u2019m fairly certain he saw it by then) I moved the car back to my driveway and took down the sign in it.

We got home and I noticed a small dent/cut in the middle back of the box. I thought it's probably nothing and I could always return it if there were any problems. You couldn't tell until it was turned on, but when we did it was completely shattered. Especially in the middle where the box dent was. I loaded it into my own car, and there was nothing to cause the dent anywhere, kept it vertical - although it was a snug fit.\n\nI called the next morning, they said no problem, bring it back for an exchange. \n\nBrought it back and the cust service woman is nice enough, takes it out and plugs it in. She had  a coworker come look, then they got the manager. The manager looked and left for a minute. Then came back with the news I knew was coming seeing as how long it was taking: \"We can't do anything for you because our employee checked the box before it left the store - so the dent must have happened after that. We can give you a discount on a new TV\". I told her to check the cameras from last night and show me there is no dent in the box I received. If no dent I'll gladly leave with the broken TV. Of course she declined, saying they don't do that with customers. At this point I was losing it. The other employees stared at the ground. I got into an argument tone, but not yelling. A couple lines I dropped were \"So you're calling me a liar? Your employee doesn't make mistakes?\" And \"why would I not shop at Amazon and have it delivered to my door for the same price? There would be no questions if it arrived damaged.\" She said I could call corporate or see another manager, which one would I like? I said both, get me the other manager. They prob knew I was staying at that counter until the police take me out.\n\nA couple mins later she comes back, says they have a new policy and they will exchange it for a new TV, because they can't prove it wasn't damaged before leaving the store. I accepted, but was still pissed that I had to get pissed for them to do what they should have done from the start. I made them open the new TV and turn it on right in front of me (should have been done the first time). I don't like getting nasty, but if I remained a gentlemen I'd be out $300.

So far the ugliest shirt I've given him is a hawiian shirt decorated with cats in tacos and the ugliest he's given me looks exactly like a bowling alley carpet.\n\nWe've never worn the shirts before now, but the last time he gave me a shirt (Nigel Thornberry as Miley Cyrus) I managed to cough while drinking and spilled coffee on the shirt I went out in. My brother told me to go put on the shirt he bought me to replace it. I went to the bathroom and put it on, and wore it until I got home.\n\nA few nights later I went to meet my brother for drinks and he was wearing the taco cat shirt. I saw this as a challenge, and since then we've both started to wear the ugly shirts when we see each other. Our girlfriends are amazing enough that not only have they accepted this, but they join in.\n\nIt didn't cause issues until last night. My girlfriend and I are in her home country (Ireland) for a week, and in I'm meeting her parents for the first time.\n\nMy brother offered to give me a lift to the airport and because he was involved, I wore a shirt he got me with the main character of Bee Movie on it.\n\nAt some point during our flight her parents decided to meet us at the airport instead, which we didn't see as we were on the plane. We got out of the airport and she immediately saw her parents and told me to put my jacket on. My zip got stuck so I was left staring down my girlfriend's parents with barry fucking benson on my chest.\n\nI tried to explain the game with my brother, playing it off as a joke, but they just drove us to the hotel silently and then went away. They're coming back in the morning. My girlfriend said that while I was checking in they told her that just from this interaction they knew we weren't a good match.\n\nMy girlfriend is upset with me, but only a little. She said that if she'd known that was the shirt I was wearing on leaving the flat, she'd have told me to leave it at home, but also feels like I should have known not to bring it along. She says I was the one who said that I wanted to make a good impression on her parents, and I should have known that this was not the time or place for the ugly shirt competition. I don't disagree with any of that, but the way I see it I have a week to fix this and I only anticipated her and my brother seeing the shirt.

Because I tend to travel frequently, I use and rely on, the public men's rooms in these office buildings. There is a specific building that I visit probably 3 to 6 times per month. (In this case, I am doing work for the building itself, and not any particular company, in any of the suites, inside the building.) For whatever reason, the public men's rooms in the hallways/common areas of this building are all locked, on every floor. This forces you to go into one of the suites and request a key from the front desk employees of the particular company leasing that space. The women's rooms are NEVER locked, on any floor, in any area. (And yes, this bothered me enough that I have checked every restroom, muliple times.) I complained to the building manager earlier this year about this situation, to which I received the reply that she, \"didn't realize this was happening, and it would be addressed.\" I returned later that week, and found the men's rooms still locked, but not the women's rooms. I then spoke with her on a separate occasion about this, to which she said she, \"forgot, but will address it today.\" Since then, I have been back to the building 9 times, all of which I found the doors still locked. (About 3 months have passed since the inital conversation.) I tried calling the building manager on 3 separate occasions, with no response. (I suspect she is avoiding me.) Because of this, I met with an attorney last week, and he sent a formal letter to the building manager that if this situation is not remedied, we have no choice but to pursue legal action on the basis of discrimination. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I just heard from my attorney this evening. He has recently spoken with the building manager. She claimed that \"it is their policy to lock ALL bathrooms, not found in suites, as a matter of public safety during business hours.\" ?????????? When questioned on why it has been consistently found that this is not the case, and ONLY the men's rooms were being locked, she gave ambiguous, nonsensical answers. She asked that I not visit the property any longer, even though I have contracted work to complete onsite. My attorney will be reaching out to the owners of the building, as there are multiple things wrong here. This is an odd situation. I'm going to assume for the time being that she is simply out-of-touch with the daily happenings in the building she manages, or is misinformed about their own policies.", "My ex and divorced, but we both remarried.

My other friend (we will call him Bob) decided he wanted to join in on this vacation. Now I want to preface something about Bob, and I am including this information because it is relevant to the story. Bob has been unemployed for a while and he dropped out of school. The only reason Bob could afford this trip was because his mother decided to let him use her credit card for the trip. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a cheap vacation, and this incident occurred on the 4th night of our trip. Allen, Bob, and I decided we would go bar hopping for the night. The three of us arrive at our first location, and Bob decides (without telling us) that he wants to get the first round of drinks and buy us food. Bob shows up to our table with an expensive appetizer and drinks for the three of us. My mind immediately thinks, \u201cI hope his mother is okay with him buying us food and drinks with her money\u201d but I decide to accept his offer and we enjoyed the food and drinks together. The bill ends up being 70 dollars.\n\nNow the night goes on and the three of us end up getting a good buzz. We arrive at our third bar for the night and I decide to buy a round of drinks for them so that I can return the generosity. I end up getting us some drinks and it comes out to about 35 dollars. Once the drinks arrive Bob made a comment to me that really put me off. Without even thanking me for the drinks he says, \u201cAlright, now that you\u2019ve spent 35 on us you just need to spend another 35 since I spent 70.\u201d\n\nI found this extremely rude\u2026.especially since we never had any form of agreement that I would have to price match him and it is not even his money.

But this one family was way, way over the line.

I am a self employed working mother.  I spend approximately 2 hours of my day driving my kids to and from school. The school is only 10 minutes from home. But because of lack of parking and the general chaos at school at pick up time, I spend an hour at each time I pickup or drop off. \n\nIn the past I have always been able to find other parents to carpool with. My children attend a small private school and finding other parents in our neighborhood to carpool with can be difficult. This year I was not able to find another family to carpool with. So, I\u2019ve been looking into other options. \n\nThe best solution I could come up with to arrange for an Uber to pick my children up from school. In the country where we live, children are permitted to ride alone in an Uber. I made arrangements with the teachers aide in my daughter\u2019s class to help them find the Uber once it arrived. After the first 2 days, my daughter\u2019s were able to find the Uber themselves and ride home. I ordered the Uber and could watch the route as they drove home. I work from home and am there to greet them when they arrived. \n\nEverything was going well until yesterday when one the teachers at the school found out that my children were ubering home everyday. Today I got a call from the principal, basically shaming me for my choice to allow my children to ride home unaccompanied. He stated, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to make a policy for this. Don\u2019t you realize it\u2019s unsafe for your kids to ride in an Uber alone? Because of you\u2019re actions, I\u2019m going to send out an email to all parents prohibiting them from allowing children to ride in taxis or uber to and from school alone\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with his suggestion that Uber is unsafe compared with other transportation options. Children at age 9 are allowed to walk home from school (this is what most parents at our school do. But we live on the other side of a busy highway and it\u2019s not possible to walk). The school offers busing. But at $2,500/yr/child, it\u2019s not affordable for us. Plus with the amount of bullying that goes on in the buses, I don\u2019t see how that is a better option.  Another option is to hire someone to pickup my girls from school. I\u2019ve done this in the past and will likely do it again now. But it is always a hassle when they are late or call off sick.

Over the past month, my brother has been looking into local doggy daycares for Ridley to be boarded up in while we're gone.

He had pretty much decided on a certain day care for Ridley spend the week at while we were on vacation. Que in my sister [17F] who starts suggesting that Ridley spend the week at her friends [17F] house (Sam). They also have a dog around the same age, and fenced in yard for the dogs to run around and play in. My brother was hesitant because he doesn't want Ridley to get anxious or excited because of the new environment at this house and possibly cause any damage, but the sister and the friend are both adamant that everything's gonna be OK. Sam had mentioned she had talked it over with her parents, and they love Ridley and would be happy to watch over her for us. Plus they'll do it for free (minus dog food and what not), so he'll be saving about $300 from not having to pay the day care. After some back and forth, my brother gives in and agrees to letting Ridley spend the week with Sam and her family.\n\nLong story short, they get back from vacation, and of course, Ridley has done some damage to their house, tore out some siding, chewed up one of their cages they tried to get her to sleep in, and some other things. Sam's dad is pretty upset and is wanting my brother to pay for the damages. My brother is pretty firm that he isn't paying anything. Sam's parents agreed to watch over Ridley and he even voiced his concern that something like this would happen, and they still knowingly wanted to dog sit Ridley. My sister and parents both think that my brother should foot the bill for the damages, or at least pay for some of the damages, but I'm kind of on my brother's side and that he shouldn't be responsible for anything.\n\nGranted, he probably could have handled everything better, like meeting with Sam's parents and discussing his concerns with them directly instead of having having everything go between my sister and Sam as his point of contact, since they aren't the ones who own the house, but Sam had originally said she talked it over with her parents, and they were fine with it as well. I'm pretty sure my brother will have to chock this up as a learning experience, and just pay them (which will probably amount to what he would have ended up paying the doggy day care) but just wanted to ask all you all here to see if we are the assholes for not wanting to pay for the damages done to the family friend's house?", "I\u2019m not going to be able to make this post with any shred decorum so let\u2019s just get right into it.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over 5 months now. Early in our relationship I borrowed a pair of his favorite sweatpants and have been holding on to them over since. They are super cozy and he was alright with me keeping them since I loved them so much and had every intention of giving them back. I have always put in an effort to take care of them and not eat any messy food in them since I know they are not mine. \n\nHowever, over the weekend I caught one of those 24 hours stomach bugs. I was feeling a little woozy and decided to spend the night in. Everything was going alright but then the worst case scenario happened and I dashed for the bathroom. I, unfortunately, didn\u2019t make it and ended up messing myself. I don\u2019t want to get into gross detail but about the 1/3 of the sweatpants were damaged. I stripped them off and tossed them outside on my front stoop to deal with later since I wasn\u2019t in the condition to deal with them then and there. The next 20 or so hours I was tied to the bathroom and spent the whole time on the bathroom floor. The next day I went to go deal with the sweatpants and they had attracted flies and were, what I saw, as a lost cause. They were a lighter grey color and I just didn\u2019t know how much could be done so I wrapped them in a plastic bag and threw them away.\n\nMy boyfriend knew I was sick at the time but I didn\u2019t tell him about the sweatpants until a few days later when I saw him face to face. He was extremely angry and wanted to know why I didn\u2019t try to save them. I don\u2019t think he realized how horrifying their condition was but he still said I should have tried. It turns out those sweatpants were more sentimental than I realized which is my mistake. They also cost more than I anticipated(~$70) which makes me feel terrible. I offered to buy him a new pair but he said it wont be the same. But, I still think that a diarrhea explosion warrants just throwing something in the trash. AITA here?", "F19 here, on mobile.\n\nI went clubbing with my friends last week. We were 3 girls, me and two of my friends. Both of them are very spontaneous and carefree personalitys, which i like about them, but sometimes being the only one in the group who is organized can be stressfull.\n\nWe were meeting in front of the club and since it was cold we were all wearing jackets, so they had their stuff in their pocktes. After we went in we gave all of our coats to the coat check guy and both of my friends put their phones and ID's out beforehand. Before we got to the dance floor, both of them asked me whether they could put their stuff in my purse because both of them didn't bring one themselves. \n\nThis has happended multiple times. Quite frankly i'm sick of it to carry their -pretty valuable- belongings around and that they just count on me being responsible all the time. Plus, 3 phones, car keys etc. are quite heavy and don't feel that good while you're dancing.\n\nSo i lied to them and said that i can take their ID's but there isn't enough space for their phones anymore. So they had to hold their phones in their hand the whole night.\n\nAITA for lying to them about not having enough space in my purse for their phones?\n\nEDIT: I told them to brinf their own purses the last time. Forgot to mention it, maybe it's important to the story, idk.", "\nMy younger sister (25f) and her husband had three kids very young. I love them like family but my partner (35m) and I (29f) are currently child free by choice.  We both have good jobs and work a lot and really appreciate our rare time off together.  Neither of us particularly like children or the stress and mess that comes with them. But family is family and recently my sister and I agreed to spend more days together with the kids so I could get to know them more as they grow up. I've enjoyed days as a group where I can enjoy the kids company but my sister and BIL can parent. I treat them to things, play games and make them laugh, it's fun but it's exhausting and it reinforces my decision to be child free. I appreciate getting to spend time with my niece and nephews though. \n\nShe's asked me to baby sit for her a few times overnight while she and BIL have a night out with her parent friends who usually babysit but everytime I've refused. I honestly just don't want to and I think that's my right. She's hinted that I don't deserve to spend time with them at all if I can't look after them alone and has threatened to stop me seeing them at all if I won't baby sit. If it were to help them out in a pinch I would happily do it but she's a full time Mum and I don't want to spend a day stressed and scared looking after three kids on my weekend.  AITA\n\n[Edit] Kids are 18months, 2.5yr and 4.", "We recently had an old friend come to live with us for awhile and help out on the farm. He arrived with 3 \u201cassault rifles\u201d which we were not told about before he came. I tried to not make a big deal about it and basically try and ignore the fact that they were here. To make a long story short and without giving too many details, our friend has not been in the happiest of head spaces and after a conversation about his dog that escalated to him yelling, I no longer feel safe in my own home. He was going to leave, but after my partner going and talking to him we tried to talk things out and come to some sort of compromise. He has agreed to take the guns off of the property when he returns home for a short period at the end of the month before returning to the farm. \n\nThis was yesterday, and after me leaving for the day to talk with friends and to process the whole situation I decided I was comfortable with him staying as long as the guns left. Last night I could hardly sleep though, and when I was able to drift off I would have bad dreams that would wake me up. This morning I tried to talk to my partner. \n\nI told him I was extremely uncomfortable and that I don\u2019t feel safe while the guns are still in the house. I asked my partner to either have him take the guns back today, or for me to go and stay in a hotel/Airbnb until they are removed from the house. He thinks I am being extremely unreasonable, and I feel like he is being way too relaxed in allowing the guns to stay on the property until the end of the month. \n\nHe said that it makes no sense for me to be okay with him having a handgun or rifle (which is part of the compromise we came to), but not the assault rifles. The truth of the matter is I\u2019m not comfortable with him having those either, but as we live on a farm with active predators guns are a necessary evil here. Honestly, it was a major adjustment for me to feel comfortable having and carrying guns on the property in the first place. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "So, my family went to Disney without me. My dad let me know in a voicemail, as he was returning a call I had about breaking up with my ex. I didn't call back, because my initial reaction was to be hurt. Namely, because I didn't feel included, and honestly, I'd love to go to Disney. They've gone now four to without me. It's not usually their fault, they go during times when I'm teaching.\n\nI guess I was feeling super passive aggressive, because I saw a post on my dad's Facebook wall of them at Disney. I decided to post, \"looks fun. Wish I could have come, too.\"\n\nApparently, it caused a huge fight within my family, and now the trip is ruined for them. I'll admit, I wanted it to be known I wanted to be part of the trip.  But I didn't intend to cause the hurt I did.\n\nI kinda feel like an asshole, so I'll just submit myself to y'all's judgement now.\n\nEdit: I tried to reach out to my dad, to ask to be part of the discussion when they do this, next time. Here was the response.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/tREL85k", "Three years ago I was depressed every day and on antidepressants and anxiolytics and self harmed almost daily. I thought myself worthless and was in depression deep. A family friend suggested I join their church and on a whim I did. I'm Catholic but nonpracticing, hadn't set foot in a church since I was in grade 3 or 4. I still don't really practice religion, but I do go to church because the community has been good for me. I made friends but more importantly I made friends who I could talk to. Everyone seemed to have my back in a good way and it helped me a lot. I like to think of myself as agnostic.\n\nA friend of mine is in a similar position to what I was years ago. She's on antidepressants and has confided in me she has dark thoughts sometimes. Trying to be vague here. I gave her the same advice I received and she was open to the idea but was apprehensive so she asked some of our mutual friends.\n\nThe vitriol I received was gargantuan. I had people message me out of the blue calling me a \"fundie\" and that I'm \"shoving my religion down her throat\". I don't even think I believe in God, I'm not invested in the church, only the people within. One of my friends said something more meaningful: I shouldn't \"prescribe religion to treat depression\", and that's true and fine. But I never suggested it was a cure or treatment. It helped me and if it can help someone else, I'd love to share it.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n[more info](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d3q7ab/aita_for_trying_to_convince_my_friend_join_my/f04nfwr/)", "Happened last night. My girl and I walked into a grocery store to buy some chips and salsa and a few other things for a party we were going to. As we walked in, there was some spilled fruit on the floor and she slipped on them. She's since gotten a bruise from it. Anyways, at first no biggie. She's pretty tough and we shrugged it off. We go to the salsa section(which is right next to the entrance) and they're out. I ask this employee that was near if they had anymore in the back. \n\nDuring this exchange he was holding in his laughter with all his will(he saw her slip) and eventually bursted out laughing before saying there was no more salsa. He then walked away still laughing about it and it looked like he told another employee since he slightly pointed at us and they both laughed. Tbh this kind of pissed me off. I'm in my early 20s myself and worked at a few grocery stores and witnessed funny shit. I've always gone to the back if I really couldn't hold in it because I didn't want to treat the customer like that. My girlfriend told me she was pretty embarrassed at the employees laughter. \n\nTo her mild protest, I went to the front and reported the spill(for any future people entering) and also told the manager of the employee laughing(I was able to catch his name). Now I didn't directly say I wanted him fired but this grocery chain tries to hold a \"reputation\" of being high end so I was pretty sure he'd be fired.\n\n We then finished up our shopping and in the parking lot he walked up to us and basically said we got him fired. I didn't want to start shit so I got into the car and drove off. We then told this story at the party and the consensus was that I was an asshole for reporting the kid and should've only mentioned the spill to the manager. They also dubbed me as a Karen.\n\nAITA?", "[removed]", "Hey all. I\u2019m currently attending University as a transfer student.\n\nThere is a girl in my class that I am really close to. She has had a hard time (both parents passed, bullied at her former college to the point she had to leave, etc). She is as sweet as can be, but she is struggling emotionally and mentally. Which, I understand why. \n\nThere is a girl in our math class who is just a straight up cunt to my friend. Mind you, my friend has never even spoken a word to this girl a day in her life. \n\nSaid girl rolls her eyes, makes nasty, rude and uncalled for comments, etc when my friend asks a question or says anything in class. She doesn\u2019t even try to hide it and I see everything she does as I sit diagonally behind her. My friend has started to notice too and it\u2019s REALLY bringing her down, literally to the point I\u2019m concerned about her well being. \n\nWell, my friend came into class the other day without a bra on and the girl made a nasty comment to her friend \u201cew, look at that. She isn\u2019t wearing a fucking bra. How disgusting\u201d \u2014 my friend noticed this and almost started crying.\n\nI\u2019ve personally had it with this girl. She\u2019s a total cunt and I\u2019m not one to let my friends, or anyone really, be treated this way. My friend has talked to everyone she needs to, but they aren\u2019t really helping whatsoever. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I just told her she needed to drop whatever issues she has with my friend and grow the fuck up? Like, we aren\u2019t in high school. This is college and this type of shit is so ridiculous and uncalled for.\n\nGranted, I wouldn\u2019t say it like that. But you guys get the point.", "[removed]", " \n\nSo I work at Walmart, in Grocery Home Shopping, which is a whole different dimension compared to the rest of the store. to start off, About a week ago my manager pulled me into his office to bitch about wait times being too high, and that I'm not fast enough despite the fact that sometimes I'm literally the only one who is trying to work fast (or even at all). On some nights co workers just sit there and talk or look at their phone while I'm stuck having to explain to everyone in the parking lot why they had to wait 20 minutes. I later found out He didn't bother talking to the slackers. This pissed me off and kinda killed my motivation to do anything more than the bare minimum.\n\nFast forward to today we had 4 dispensers for the entire day, but we found out that all of us were going to be leaving before 8:00 (our closing time) my shift ended at 5:00pm Maria's at 4:00pm Alexandra's at 5:30pm and Jim at 3:30. We looked at the schedule to see if anyone was coming after we all left, and there was literally not a single associate scheduled after 6pm. soon, Gabe (the manager) rose from the darkest,of hell (happens once a year) to ask Maria if she wanted to cover the closing shift, to which she declined because she doesn't want to dispense anymore,\n\nhe turns to the rest of us, Alexandra had dinner plans already made and Jim had already disappeared at this point. So i was the only one without plans after work. Going back to what i went over in the beginning, i was bitter towards Gabe and not really looking forward for covering his ass considering he brought this on himself.\n\nI knew he still had options, using one of the support managers, or pulling one or two cashiers off a register, but naturally he chose to just clock out on time and let someone else figure it out. So i let the support manager know what was going on and quietly left 15 minutes late. there really weren't that much orders for the night, we finished every pick by 3:00 which is an hour before it is supposed to be finished, and there were only 3 orders to be dispensed between 6-7 and 4 between 7-8, so whoever is covering me while i sit back, drink a beer, write this post is probably just sitting around, waiting for the clock to hit eight\n\nThe reason i think i may be TA here is that;\n\n1. Some Support Manager who has like a million things better to do is sitting in the OGP backroom waiting for that one customer to arrive at 7:59\n2. Gabe's precious \"Numbers\"(wait times for groceries) that he bitched at me about might of taken a hit if there's no one there to dispense\n3. i may of indirectly hurt Alexandra because she told me she didn't want to just let Gabe take the fall, and may of stayed past her shift (i don't know if she did or not)\n\nReasons im NTA:\n\n1. I don't HAVE to work overtime\n2. Gabe is a doo doo head\n3. There wasn't that many orders, very slow night which is uncharacteristic for a Saturday\n\nAt this point its up to you to decide, cause im kinda torn on whether or not i should've stayed", "[deleted]", "I work away extensively and at the moment am doing Monday through to Thursday week. getting home late Thursday. It's a labour intensive job and I'm usually wrecked the Friday and come good Saturday Sunday. My S.O is doing placement and my excess pay is going towards paying her a wage so she can afford the 6+ weeks she can't work while doing unpaid placement.\n\nHer grandfather's second wife has just recently had a stroke and isn't doing well. they're worried she may pass away soon. her father is planning on going down to see them this weekend but my S.O is worried she may not last till then, so I offered to cover flights up and back with a 2 night stay, that way she doesn't add more time to her placement, which is time based. she is considering it, but really the weekend trip with her father would be ideal for the current situation. no more time added to her placement means less for me out of pocket, not even considering cost of flights and shit.\n\nShe's considering doing the weekend trip but has asked me to come with considering I get back the Thursday. I don't really want to. i feel like the 10+ hour drive after a 6+ hour drive home from work will be to much. I also have a mates 21st which I've rsvpd for 4months ago.

I've since offered to go and have roped my parents into doing a bulk of my washing for me while we're away (reminds me of high school). that way I'm not getting back Sunday and spending the whole day washing, only re-packing. The grandmother's condition has worsened so there's a possibility that it'll be a last minute rush for flights anyway but we'll just have to see how it all plays out", "I (32M) left my High School 14 years ago. In the UK, we refer to High School as Secondary School. Same thing basically. I stayed at the same school for my Sixth Form (age 16-18).\n\nI was bullied at this school. I was an anxious kid and unfortunately people were cruel. Teachers were apathetic. It was not a good time. I only began standing up for myself towards the end.\n\nI now run a successful business and it's made more than two million this past year. It's definitely known in the regional papers near that school. Well the school asked me to come back and give a talk + Q&A and I agreed.\n\nSchool just started back up last week so I came on the Friday. I was mainly speaking to the Year 11 (age 15 to 16) assembly. Had around 150 kids.\n\nSo I give my presentation on how I made my money and got my business running, and afterwards do a Q&A. I get some questions, but one question is what role I think school played in my success, I told them:\n\n\"Well, not much....I guess it motivated me to get out of this place. The kids were cruel and the teachers here, and I realize this will sound bad, but they're useless. I'm sure those of you getting bullied here will realize that...these teachers are useless, and I don't give a single one of them credit....only I am responsible for my success. My own sheer force of will resulted in my success\"\n\nThere were only two teachers overseeing this assembly, but they looked embarrassed and awkward...another kid asked me about bullying, so I answered with my own experience and the mindset I believe he needs to cultivate:\n\n\"I was bullied by this one kid...noone did anything even after I asked for help. In the end....I had to play fire with fire. I came up with a nasty rumour about the kid...which worked. His mental health tanked and he had to move school...you have to see your enemies as enemies. They're not your friends and people like that don't truly mature. You have to destroy those who seek to destroy you. That's the mindset I took in the business world and look what it's done for me.\"\n\nI had some of the quieter and shy kids come to talk to me after my talk, and I saw my younger self in them. I offered them work placements at my business (which would do wonders for their CV/resume) but I also instilled my mentality in them.\n\nNow obviously the headmaster confronted me after this, and he was the same one who was there when I was there, but I told him bluntly \"Your school is shit...you're always at the bottom of the rankings and in 14 years you haven't changed shit\". He flipped me off and told me to get out.\n\nOn the one hand I recognise I went too overboard, but when I say this school is shit, I mean it. The teachers here are sellouts. I want these kids to survive so I told them how I succeed. AITA?", "  \n\nMy bf Ben is one of those \"never met a stranger\" people. He\u2019s  friendly, outgoing and makes friends easily and often. We live in a big city and he is probably the only person who knows all his neighbors by name and something about them. Ben has a lot of interests and meets new people (men and women) through these and ends up being friends with them and inviting them to other things. I don't really mind but it\u2019s annoying when it\u2019s a female bc there have been instances in the past where they get crushes on Ben and, although I trust him, I would rather not have some chick flirting with my bf (he doesn\u2019t flirt back and usually stops inviting those girls or tries to fix them up with a friend). This past spring Ben met Leah through a running group. She was new to town, in a similar industry as Ben and they have tons in common. Ben invited her to trivia night. Leah is not only beautiful but she's funny, athletic and interesting. While I wasn't cold or mean to her I didn't seek her out in conversation and always held her at arm\u2019s length. Turns out they are training for the same marathon so she also joined his long run group. Leah fit in with our friend group so she is around often. Since she and Ben are in the same industry, she's also at some networking things, too. I was getting tired of her being around all the time and a little insecure bc they have so much in common but they've never done or said anything that makes me suspicious. I've even glanced at their text exchanges (Ben asked me to look up an address she had sent in a text so I wasn't snooping) and there is nothing flirty or inappropriate. He's mentioned before that it doesn't seem like I like Leah and I've always denied it and said we just don't have a lot in common or I was busy talking to someone else. \n\nWell, a couple weeks ago Leah shows up with Jill and introduces her as her girlfriend. Ben says something like \"oh, its so nice to finally meet you\" indicating he'd known Leah was a lesbian. I won't lie- I felt a huge weight lifted off me and had more fun that night than since Leah joined our group. Ever since then I've talked to her more and found  I really like her. The other day, someone made a joke about how I was an asshole until I found out Leah was a lesbian and not going to steal Ben away. Leah laughed it off but Ben looked a little bothered and asked me later if that was true. I admitted that her being a lesbian made me more comfortable with their friendship. He was upset with me and thought that showed a lack of trust and faith in him. I told him that he knew I wasn't totally comfortable with their friendship and it would've been nice of him to tell me she was a lesbian. He said that he had just found out about two weeks before I did and that it wasn't his place to \"out\" her to me and he thought I didn't like her for something else, not bc I was jealous. \n\nAITA for only being friends with her after I found out she wasn't \"competition\"?", "I grew up in an upper middle-class family and my parents helped me out with education and a stipend to study. In return, my parents had input in my major and how I spent my time. I went along with it because of their generous contributions to my education and every-day expenses. They were very nosy and felt they had to approve my relationships as well. When I started dating the son of one of their closest friends, they were elated. I went along with it and we got married.\n\nWe had kids and I decided to stay home with them. When our kids were 4 and 2, I decided to go back to work. My husband was self-employed and had crazy hours. He wanted me to continue staying home with the kids. My parents always sided with my husband and in fact, my parents and parent-in-law would get together and weigh in on our decisions. I expressed my concerns about  not being able to re-enter the workforce if I continue to stay home. They (parents) vowed to take care of me and not to worry. \n\nSo, my husband turned out to be doing some shady things with our family money and the business that he ran. He was abusing our money on side girlfriends. When I found out that our life savings had eroded to almost nothing and the infidelity, I filed for divorce. There was no income  so my child support was a ridiculous amount. I found some evidence that he was hiding money in shell accounts. I told my parents that I wanted to get a lawyer and try to recoup some funds. They dissuaded me (because it would have ruined their relationship with their close friend) and again said they're take care of me.\n\nI went back to work and my degree was useless by then without relevant work experience and making minimum wage. They bought me a condo but otherwise I was scraping by for years. Then a year ago, my mom suddenly died from a blood clot. My dad almost immediately re-married to a woman decades his junior. He announced last week that he'd be changing his will to his new wife and cutting me out because he needs to make sure she will be supported. That was supposed to have been my nest egg. I was furious because I had directed my life to appease him and now he is cutting me out for a floozy who clearly does not care for him.
