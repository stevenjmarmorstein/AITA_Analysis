My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).\n\nExtended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.\n\nEventually my sister got really fed up and said \u201cShut up, I\u2019m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.\u201d My brother hadn\u2019t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. \n\nAnyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he\u2019s a virgin and she didn\u2019t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn\u2019t need to be made fun of like this.\n\nSo I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it\u2019s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn\u2019t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.\n\nFamily is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.", "Pretty much the title. My son won a stuffed tiger at the fair last night and said he had named him \"Tig\". He asked me what its last name should be. I couldn't help myself and just instantly replied \"Bitties\". Then I turned to my wife to share a smirk, but she was pissed and quickly suggested a few different last names, but my son insisted that he liked \"Bitties\", so now his Tiger is Tig Bitties. My wife thinks it was completely inappropriate, I think it was a silly joke that went over his head and will have no negative ramifications.", "The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlong with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents \"expect\" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was \"grounded\" because i turned my phone off in the theater.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her \"slave\" for the rest of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit/Update kinda:\n\nWow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. Thank you all again for the love and support through this <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll send an update your guy's way later this week if people are interested. ", "I recently won a \u2018fuck you\u2019 amount of money. I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n", "New to reddit, please bare with. \n\nSo I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. \n\nHowever, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says \"but I didn't\". \n\nWhen she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd \"threatened\" to do it before (I literally just said \"okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything\" before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?", "My best friend Jake's wife died about a month ago in a car crash and he's handling it terribly. He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n Edit: Thanks, reading all your responses have shed a lot of light on how what I did was terrible and came off as me not caring about him. I'll go talk to him a few hours from now and apologize & let him stay here if he needs. I'll discuss his living situation and if he can't stay in his house I'll see what I can do.\n\n\n Edit pt. 2: Tommy is winning BB21 we love a gay icon (sept. 11 2019)", "Ok this is the worst. I\u2019m losing sleep over this.\n\nI\u2019m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.\n\nMy brother is gay, but my family doesn\u2019t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century\u2019s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.\n\nSo my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I\u2019m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it\u2019s kind of a secret, as he hasn\u2019t told my family he is gay.\n\nI\u2019ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.\n\nBut he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won\u2019t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn\u2019t accept my brother being gay.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s his decision not mine, so for now he won\u2019t say anything.\n\nUntil a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.\n\nIf it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don\u2019t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don\u2019t want to get the attention away from my fianc\u00e9e, that\u2019s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it\u2019s a pretty good reason\n\nI asked him why my wedding day, he said it\u2019s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can\u2019t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. \n\nI didn\u2019t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse\n\nWith a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.\n\nNext day I got a text and he said \u201c dont worry, going alone\u201d. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don\u2019t seem to know what\u2019s happening because they didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nHe eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us\n\nThis is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?\n\nPS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!\n\nPS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!\n\nUpdate: spoke to fianc\u00e9e, couldn\u2019t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.\n\nClarification: I know it won\u2019t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn\u2019t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don\u2019t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother\u2019s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING. Also, MY BROTHER IS NOT THE ASSHOLE. Not at all.", "**UPDATED 7:50 PM:** Holy crap! Thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating \"mistakes can happen.\" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?\n\nEdit: Grammar", "I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.\r\n\r\nBoth my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. \r\n\r\nWell I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. \r\n\r\nCurrently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. AITA for ruining my parents marriages?", "\nThrowaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.\n\nI was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she\u2019s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s fine I have my dads credit card I\u2019m not paying \u201d which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I\u2019ve told my son multiple times he\u2019s never allowed to use my card so I\u2019m interested to see how this girl thinks she\u2019s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.\n\nWe end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can\u2019t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn\u2019t her card but her father\u2019s and I\u2019m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I\u2019ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don\u2019t think she was ever told no.\n\nGirl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it\u2019s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I\u2019ve pointed out it wasn\u2019t hers cashier tells her she can\u2019t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it\u2019s still fraud. Girl says it\u2019s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she\u2019s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong. \n\nSo Reddit, ATIA?", "**EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS.

Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\nEdit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.\n\nEdit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too.

Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.\n\nEdit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough.

I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. \n\nI thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.

Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.\n\nFor example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.\n\nSo, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!.

They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.\n\nWe put our foot down and said:\n\n>Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached.

I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. \n\nToday when she said \"morning slim\" I replied \"morning chunky\" and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is \"different\" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a \"compliment\".

My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.\n\nToday I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly \u00a31800) since it was completely ruined. \n\nI have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault. \n\nAm I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?", "I got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an \"Appletarian\", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. \n\nI told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. \n\nApples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. \n\nFinally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.\n\nBut I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. \n\nThey were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. \n\nI thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had \"embarrassed her for a dumb joke\". \n\nIn my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. \n\nBut, did I go too far?\n\n", "I've worked at my office for 8 years. I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.\n\u200b\n\nFive months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.\n\n\u200b\n\nSupervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said \"This is John\" and described my job.\n\n\u200b\n\nTed: \"Hi, Jack.\"\n\nMe: \"It's John.\"\n\n\u200b\nTed: \"What?\"\n\u200b\n\nMe: \"My name's John, not Jack.\"\n\nTed: \"It's close enough for me.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nThis continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him \"You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nHis response was \"Sure thing, Jackie boy.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nSince I don't work directly with him, I figured \"screw it\" and that I'd ignore him.\n\n\u200b\n\nRecently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says \"Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!\"\n\n\u200b\n\n(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)\n\n\u200b\n\nAs promised, I ignored him.\n\n\u200b\n\n7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.\n\nThe first one was along the lines of \"Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.\"\n\nE-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.\n\n\u200b\n\nI signed out and went home. It was raining hard.\n\nNext morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams \"Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!\" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.\n\n\u200b\n\nSupervisor: \"Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nI relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.\n\nSupervisor: \"I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt.\" he sighed and said \"With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nA few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.\n\n\u200b\n\n*AM* I the a-hole on this?", "This line at a Starbucks I went to was really long. I was in line for a good maybe 20 minutes. Until this lady in a Mercedes tries to cut in front of me and like 8 others behind me.

So I waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, I honk. She then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which I already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. Each time she makes an attempt to order something I honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. We stopped as soon as she drove off. We then ordered and went about our day. \n\nI just can\u2019t people who are extremely rude like that lady and I couldn\u2019t simply let this go. \n\nAITA for this?", "My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out.

Am i an asshole?", "I\u2019m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I\u2019ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there\u2019s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.\n\nShe exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.\n\nAfter her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She\u2019s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide \u201cThe Rules\u201d like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who\u2019s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.\n\nBut I doubt she loves him. We\u2019ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been open with me that she doesn\u2019t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt \u201cpretty neutral\u201d about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she\u2019s ever done, and doesn\u2019t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.\n\nHer boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it\u2019ll scare him away. I\u2019ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this \u201csecret\u201d from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to sabotage my daughter\u2019s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend\u2019s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won\u2019t end the relationship. It\u2019s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he\u2019s bound to find out she\u2019s a bit \u201coff\u201d; it can\u2019t be kept a secret forever. AITA?", "The title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.\n\nI\u2019m 24 and I\u2019m an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. \n\nI used and used until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. \n\nShe\u2019s my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. \n\nShe also met her fianc\u00e9 two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. He\u2019s not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much I put my sister through. \n\nDespite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there. \n\nWhen I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. \n\nWhen I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I \u201cdidn\u2019t bring anything in\u201d.  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn\u2019t I, and I tell him not to touch me. \n\nHe tells me to \u201ccalm down\u201d and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this.

My sister has refused to take any sides in this. \n\nAITA?", "What I thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and I'm up at 7:05 AM dealing with it. I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. \n\nI'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the \"harmless, funny token fat guy\" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. \n\nLast night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. \n\nWell to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of \"you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?\" \n\nI offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. \n\nI woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. \n\nWas I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?\n\nEdit: I guess I\u2019ve been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can\u2019t find out why.\n\nTo answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn\u2019t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it\u2019s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don\u2019t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.", "My parents divorced when I was 3, and went into separate marriages. I had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. When I was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. I had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.\n\nFive years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. My mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. My father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. Obviously my family is morning, and I've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.\n\nThe only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and I'm not going to let that happen. I told my wife that I was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. She did not take it well and is furious that I would choose my brother over her. I doubt my marriage will survive, but I can't let my brother go into foster care.\n\nEDIT: LC", "My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I\u2019ve been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I\u2019ve always been supportive of him and his identity. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son \u2013 at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I\u2019ve gotten to know him really well. However my fianc\u00e9 told me recently that she does not want my son\u2019s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He\u2019s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic \u2013 that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It\u2019s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. \n\nAfter that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn\u2019t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here \u2013 that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it\u2019s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his \u201cstep grandparents\u201d in the future anyway. I still don\u2019t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?", "For reference, my brother Connor is 19, I am 26, and my (now ex) fianc\u00e9 Hunter is 28. Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.\n\nConnor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it\u2019d be fun to act like college students again.\n\nWe all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement \u201cNever Have I Ever cheated before\u201d came up.\n\nNow\u2019s a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fianc\u00e9 cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my \u201cboyfriend\u201d of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).\n\nWell my brother knows about this so when I didn\u2019t drink, he went \u201chey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex\u2019s name*). You have to drink to that!\u201d\n\nMy boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room.

He was my everything and more and I still don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to move on.\n\nConnor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn\u2019t mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn\u2019t think when he said those words.

Am I being unreasonable?", "I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? ", "Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit. Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.\n\nAs soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.\n\nThis released an even bigger tirade and series of \"what the fuck is your problem\"-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her \"Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now\". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.\n\nI noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so I kinda wondered if I stepped too much out of line there.", "I'm sitting at the airport and this older lady sat down right next to me and took her iPad out and starts watching a show quite loud. \n\nTo me this is a foul in public however I just ignored it and put my earbuds in. \n\nAfter a while I made a phone call using my earbuds. Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\nQuick edit. I turned the music video off almost immediately after she left. ", "I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.\n\nI told them \"you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense.\" But they kind of laughed my warning off.\n\nNow, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.\n\nThe llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a \"warning spit\" (just saliva) and they went \"eww\" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.\n\nFinally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.\n\nTo make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.\n\nAITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.", "When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a \"contract\" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. \n\nWe made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.\n\nWife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the \"how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?\" card and I said \"Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?\" and she just up and screamed. \n\nThis has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. \n\nThe car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price. \n\nSo AITA?", "I love strawberries. I love them so much that I planted 300 strawberry plants in my garden. After I harvest, I make lots of strawberry jelly to give to my family, friends, and neighbors. I donate the leftovers to my local food bank.\n\nLately I've had a big problem with all the neighborhood kids coming in my yard and stealing my strawberries. The last time I caught them I threatened them with the police because they was so reckless they smashed over 50 of my plants.\n\nI caught them in my yard again this afternoon, instead of calling the police I grabbed my garden hose and sprayed them while chasing them out of my yard. \n\nI just had a group of angry parents come to my house complaining about my actions. Absolutely none of them was willing to apologize for their children's actions. One parent in particular is threatening to sue me, because her son's iPhone 10 was ruined with water. I told her that was her problem for letting her eight-year-old son have a $1,000 phone. Then I threatened to spray them with my hose if they didn't get off of my property.", "I\u2019m 26 and clean from heroin for 3 years. \n\nI was also a piece of shit and used to deal for a while. \n\nI managed to get with a beautiful girl named Marcy when I first started getting into the thick of things. She knew who I was but she said she loved me. \n\nI will regret this for the rest of my life, but I was the person who shot up Marcy for the first time. After that, there was no stopping her. She stuck around with me, probably because I was her dealer more than anything, but then I got clean and never saw her again for a long time. \n\nA year ago she reached out to me on Facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn\u2019t hate me for what happened and she hoped I was still clean. \n\nLast week I got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on Facebook that Marcy had OD\u2019d and there was a funeral service this upcoming Thursday.\n\nI immediately just burst into tears because I hoped that this would never happen and I feel so much guilt over it. \n\nI want to go to the funeral service for her but I\u2019m afraid that my presence would be unwanted. At the most I would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave. I need to do this for myself. \n\nAITA for wanting to go?", "I have waited tables for the last three years.\n\nDuring my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. \n\nWhen I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.\n\nAbout five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. \n\nA few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.\n\nIt was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.\n\nSeveral minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. \n\nI stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. \n\nBut when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.", "I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'\n\nSo the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, \"How do you pronounce that?\" It's Tina!\n\nI have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, \"Just for the record, my name is Tina!\" to lighthearted, \"Tina, like Tina Belcher!\" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, \"Thanks Tiana!\" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:\n\nChuck: Thanks, Tiana\n\nTina: No problem, Chad!\n\nJessica: Hi Tiara!\n\nTina: Good morning, Jennifer!\n\nWould I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.\n\nEDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:\n\nA lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!\n\nA lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.\n\nA lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!\n\nAnd finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.\n\nEDIT #2:\n\nNo, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or \"Tiara\"\n\nNo, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.\n\nNo, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!\n\nYes, I correct them every time.\n\nNo, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!\n\nResponding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!", "When I was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life.\n\nMy parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.\n\nMy mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.\n\nThis year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.\n\nThe thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all. The only thing tying me to her is my father saying \"She is your sister\" and \"If she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?\"\n\nAITA?", "My daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. A boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL\u2019s profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as \u201ca vapid slut\u201d and her husband \u201ca pathetic cuck\u201d along with other slurs I don\u2019t want to repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that\u2019s too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister\u2019s career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I\u2019m going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We\u2019re definitely concerned for our daughter about what\u2019s happening at school and we\u2019re looking into therapy.\n\nFor clarification, as for my SIL\u2019s privacy, she didn\u2019t consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.", "Me (28M) and fiancee (27F) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. I also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.\n\nOn Saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. I stayed with my parents but I left the dog with her because she likes having him there. However, *I made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.\n\n5am on Sunday I get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.\n\nBut then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.\n\nWhen we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I'll tell mine. She was shocked, but she took her things and left.\n\n2 hours later, I get bombarded by messages on Messenger, Whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that I am insane to do this to her after 4 years. They started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.\n\nThe logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. Nope. They all fucking agree. My mom said: \"Well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!\" Lucky me, eh? My dog didn't fucking die!\n\nMy sister was appalled that I cancelled the wedding \"over *that*?!\" and even my best man said I might have overreacted. Yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. But I am so disgusted at my fiancee that I can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. She isn't fucking 17, she is 27!\n\nBy the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. She likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar DANGEROUS things. It's not something I hold against her in the sense that I would ever mention in a fight, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. For example, my dog.\n\nI'm 99% sure I will stand by my decision. But am I really an asshole? Literally nobody is on my side and I have no idea what to think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: Posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. She is negligent and irresponsible and I don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. I'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. If she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, I would also leave her.

My mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.\n\nMy sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her.\n\nIt all began when I asked what religion he was. Imagine my surprise when she said that he was Hindu AND THE SAME COMMUNITY AS OUR PARENTS. This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.\n\nI asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. \nI suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.\n\nI explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. \n\nShe told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.\n \nAt this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.\n\n\nLater my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding.

After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. \n\nSince all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. \n\nI'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices.

I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?", "On my gf's birthday I gave her a necklace that I spent $400 on.  I wasn't expecting her to spend the same as me, but I was expecting something.\n\nHere's how it went down.  After dinner she asked me if I was ready for my gift, I said yes and she started giving me oral.  She doesn't like giving oral and I'm ok with it.  She was giving bad oral and honestly I just wanted her to stop, then she gets up and pulls me into my room and we have sex.\n\nI feel disappointed.   I don't think sex is a gift.  I didn't expect a gift that was equal to what I spent, but I wanted a least something.", "I'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. I have a car that I bought with money I'd saved from work, and I pay my own gas. However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.\n\nThey said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.\n\nI'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.\n\nAnyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side open\n\nMy friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. \n\nRight now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.\n\nSo I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.\n\nAnd that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.\n\nAITA for what I did?", "So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we\u2019re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven\u2019t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what\u2019s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the \u201csecrets\u201d I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying \u201cJust don\u2019t let mom find out\u201d The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out \u201cI cheated on my wife...\u201d At first it didn\u2019t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife\u2019s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They\u2019ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) \nHe told me life has been good to him now and he\u2019s just thankful things have finally worked out. \n\nAs stated before I hate cheaters and I\u2019ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it\u2019s the right thing to do, especially because I\u2019ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it\u2019s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don\u2019t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?\n\nTLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she\u2019s a close friend. WIBTA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong.\n\nSecond Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.", "I know from the title, it definitely sounds like I would be the asshole but please hear me out. I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don\u2019t know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. \n\nRecently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we\u2019ve hosted them in the past when they\u2019ve visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. \n\nThis weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn\u2019t pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. \n\nOnce they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here\u2019s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn\u2019t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn\u2019t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn\u2019t say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. \n\nI guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should\u2019ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT for added info: \n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. There\u2019s not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. \n\n1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad\u2019s first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I\u2019m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he\u2019s the generation after mine in our family tree and it\u2019s less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it\u2019s not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don\u2019t care, and my family\u2019s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it\u2019s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don\u2019t know how after this situation). \n\n2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he\u2019s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son\u2019s safety. I didn\u2019t know how he would react and followed my cousin\u2019s lead, but wasn\u2019t about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. \n\n3. I don\u2019t know what was said to my paternal grandmother but I don\u2019t want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we\u2019ve both had time to process what happened and calmed down.", " I will try to keep it very short so as to not bore anyone. About six months or so ago my grandpa died. For simplicity sake, let\u2019s say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. In his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  His estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in California. Basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. M\n\nI got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. For the last six months I\u2019ve allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but I just got my first tax bill and I either have to sell it or start making some income off it. After talking to the real estate agent I\u2019ve decided the best course of action is to put it on Airbnb. That way I can still use it if I like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there\u2019s not someone renting full-time.\n\n My sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all I know she\u2019s upset because she can no longer use the house for free. But she\u2019s also telling me that I basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. She has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. She also says it\u2019s not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but I still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house I could stay there any time I want.  She\u2019s my older sister and I\u2019ve always been impressionable to the things she says to me and I\u2019m feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. Am I the asshole here?", "Okay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. \n\nI got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by \"pretending they're bad people\" and \"making up false homophobia accusations\". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid. Did I do the wrong thing? Should I have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?", "Saw another post that reminded me of this situation.\n\nA few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.\n\nI pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn\u2019t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they\u2019re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn\u2019t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?\n\nEdit- okay I get it I\u2019m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn\u2019t think the triplets had different fathers. I\u2019m not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair", "This happened a couple weeks ago, but I'm still conflicted about it, so here goes. \n\nI travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. Most recently, I was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. This wouldn't be a problem except that I had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket I paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way I had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (Because I take this specific route and airline a lot, I knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can't recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since I just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)\n\nOf course, when it came time to board, I get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. I politely told her that she'd made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. Her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before I got there, and would I do her the favor of just switching?\n\nHere's the thing: if circumstances were different, I would have! But I explained that I had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that I could sleep. I really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids' seatbelts RIGHT THEN AND THERE. \n\nBy this point the plane is filling up, I'm blocking the aisle, it's causing a whole thing, so I just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. The mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. The flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as I did) goes, \"This is an exit row. Your kids can't sit there because they're not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. There's not going to *be* another empty row. Please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.\"\n\nSo I sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and I figure that's the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, I push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. When we land, I'm getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, \"You look like you slept well, bitch.\"\n\nSo, Reddit. Am I the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?\n\n**EDITED TO ADD:** Okay, thanks Reddit, I think most of you agree that I'm not the asshole here. But please do me a favor and don't refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. The kids were just fine. They watched something on their iPad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. Kids don't like flying more than anyone else, and it's not these girls' fault their mom acted like a jerk.", " My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.\n\nMy husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said \"We might not even have kids\" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.\n\nSo this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.\n\nI was annoyed by this and said \"There's really no chance.\"\n\nMIL, all wide-grin, said, \"Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!\"\n\nI said \"We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,\" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.\n\nMIL gets more annoyed and says \"Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!\"\n\nHusband said, \"Mom, enough.\" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said \"MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.\"\n\nWell, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how \"I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother.\" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.\n\nMy MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really \"need\" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said \"Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding.\" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)\n\nI hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?", "So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing. \n\nWhen I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. \n\nWe had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. \n\nTwo weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! \n\nI asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. \n\nMy wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a \"real\" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.\n\nLike I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?\n\nEdit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she\u2019s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She\u2019s always been awesome to me and she\u2019s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly\n\nedit2: are the \u201cmommy bailed you out\u201d comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it\u2019s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not paying for it on my own eventually.\n\nEdit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?\n\nEdit4: I\u2019m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I\u2019m still reading because honestly I\u2019m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another\n\nEdit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you\u2019re a mod, do you know? I can\u2019t respond to any posts and get the \u201cstatus 403\u201d whenever I try. Thanks!\n\nEdit in the morning: I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was getting so many private\u2019s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn\u2019t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I\u2019ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I \u201chad come to your senses\u201d I don\u2019t want to disappoint her. It\u2019s going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.", "For the last year I\u2019ve had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. \n\n\nAbout a week ago I went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if I wanted a receipt. At this point I figured I had just used a deal I don\u2019t know about, but the next time I went the same thing happened. So the next several times I\u2019ve gone I\u2019ve made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it\u2019s been free.\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking something is wrong and I should tell someone, but I kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. AITA?\n\nUpdate: Hi guys\n\nI thought I had the golden ticket, I really did. \n\nI thought I had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. The rewards card that wouldn\u2019t stop rewarding. Last night I dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.\n\n\nI wanted to ask you fine people if I was the asshole real quick before I went balls deep and pilfered my way through a Midwest convenience store chain. I\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t care what people said though. I was high on the fact that I had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.\n\n\nAfter I made the post I made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, \u201cI mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it\u2019s good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn\u2019t steal\u201d\n\n\nI made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause I was sleepy. And then I went to perform the maneuver. I strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.\n\nIt was a gift card. \n\n\nI had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, I found it and my dumb little brain couldn\u2019t read the text that said \u201cgift card\u201d on the bottom.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like \u201calright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82.\u201d But I sucked it up and paid, and now all I have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.\n\nTL;DR I thought I had it all but now I just have a lot of eggs.\n\nUpdate 2: to everyone saying this is a made up story, I can tell you unfortunately it is not. I wouldn\u2019t be able to eggzagerate something like this.", "I hate flying to the point that I will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. It's not that I'm scared of flying, I just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.\n\nSo I only fly if I can buy a second seat (or third if I'm flying with my wife). It lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. Also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class AND for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. I'm a big guy but I 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said \"you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats\".\n\nOn multiple flights I've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no I bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem. \n\nAITA for never backing down in this scenario that has happened 6-7 times at this point? If I was willing to fly with one seat I wouldn't have bought a second seat.\n\nNote - I do not take two seats on the train/bus EVER. They are way more comfortable and you can stand whenever etc so I don't feel cramped and trapped like on a plane.", "So, my husband has this friend, I\u2019ll call him Alex. Alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. Alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don\u2019t share his far right views. The rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn\u2019t invited to game nights anymore. If you tell him Alex, I want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he\u2019ll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying \u201cYou just can\u2019t defend your side so you\u2019re too afraid to talk about it.\u201d\n\nAnyway, one day, my husband had Alex and another friend over, Joe. They were working on a project out in the garage together. I was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. I have a huge dog that isn\u2019t fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40\u00b0F outside so she couldn\u2019t go out there with them. Luckily I had my best friend over to help, but still. So while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. NBD. When the pup finally goes to sleep, Alex came inside to get something. I told him \u201cYour dog is asleep. Don\u2019t wake her, it\u2019s finally peaceful in here.\u201d And what does he do? Comes over to pet her and mess with her. So I told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because I wasn\u2019t going to spend my night keeping the peace when I wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn\u2019t live anywhere near me. \n\nAnyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until I couldn\u2019t hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. I walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said \u201cIt\u2019s so loud that we can\u2019t hear the TV\u201d. \n\nAlex responded with \u201cWell turn up your TV then.\u201d I had a moment where I was too shocked to speak. So I unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it\u2019s my house, not his.\n\nApparently after I left, he started talking about how annoying I was *to my husband* and that he thought I acted bitchy. My husband told me all of this later that night in bed and I asked what he said to Alex. \u201cNothing, really\u201d I got angry with my husband, and told him that he should\u2019ve stood up for me. We had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. \n\nThe next day, I told my husband that Alex was no longer welcome in our home. My husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so I compromised with \u201cAlex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.\u201d\n\nSo AITA?", "So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she\u2019s heard good things about. We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I\u2019m hungry. \n\nI look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I\u2019ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.\n\nSo anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it\u2019s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter \u201cwhere\u2019s the rest of my steak?\u201d and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don\u2019t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it\u2019s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it\u2019s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.\n\nI\u2019m complaining to my girlfriend and she\u2019s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I\u2019m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. \n\nWhen the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that\u2019s where we\u2019re different, I don\u2019t let businesses push me around and rip me off. \n\nA manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don\u2019t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald\u2019s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It\u2019s now the next day and I\u2019m starting to think I didn\u2019t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount). My girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to my texts so now I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019m an asshole.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)\n\nSo, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. \n\nWell, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn\u2019t I tell her earlier and she\u2019s so proud of me\n\nBut seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...\n\nI going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.\n\nUpdate 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn\u2019t know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update \n\nSo after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:\n\n> I\u2019m sorry for how I reacted; please don\u2019t be mad. I\u2019m so happy for you and your accomplishments. It\u2019s just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you\u2019re going to be where I wanted to be and I\u2019m just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m ranting I just need more time\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I\u2019m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don\u2019t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we\u2019re going to drift apart which would suck because we\u2019re best friends and I just don\u2019t want to lose my sister :(\n\nUpdate 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). \n\nThen they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.\n\nI stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.\n\nI still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.\n\nUpdate 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)", "My sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that \"fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!\" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noped out of there fast as I could. I didnt mean to expose a lie, i was just trying to understand my sister more. WITAH?", "A few months ago, my brother and now SIL announced their intention to marry. The invitation to the wedding stated \"No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you.\" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.\n\nYesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.\n\nA few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified \"not formal\" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.\n\nWas I in the wrong?\n\nEdit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.\n\nEdit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that's a good sign.\n\nEdit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. So yeah, I don't think we're gonna be on Jerry Springer as far as I can tell.", "My son started second grade last week. I get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). \n\nHe's got a twin sister. I told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. My son picked one up and said \"I want to wear this.\" I'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. \n\nI figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. \n\nI drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. \n\nMy wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as \"the one who wore a dress\" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. \n\nAt the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. AITA", "Edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought I\u2019d make an edit. My piercing is NOT a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. Septum piercings are usually tagged as \u201clooking like a bull\u201d (I don\u2019t agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.\n\nHere\u2019s how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of \u201ctake that thing out of your nose, you\u2019re ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull.\u201d The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn\u2019t be so polite. To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I\u2019m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn\u2019t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. \n\nFast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she\u2019s insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? I\u2019m usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn\u2019t even make sense) does not \u201cruin\u201d my face and even if it does it\u2019s really not her place. I\u2019m a grown ass woman and I refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman. \n\nSo, was I the asshole?", "I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.\n\nOver the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I\u2019d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. \n\nWell a friend\u2019s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I\u2019d be happy to give him his quarters back if he\u2019d asked but I\u2019m not a casino and while I\u2019m not destitute, I can\u2019t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. \n\nSo was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?\n\nEdit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as \"why are you so shity?\" because I've been banned.\n\nEdit2: wow since I\u2019m a \u201cbaby gangster\u201d who has been running an \u201cillegal gaming operation\u201d (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I\u2019m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.\n\nEdit3: gotta address this one directly:\n\n>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.\n\nIf the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I\u2019ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the \u201cwinner\u201d thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75\u2013who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters\u2014when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN\u2019T be this dramatic in real life...I\u2019m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I\u2019m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don\u2019t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don\u2019t  in the process.\n\nEdit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I\u2019ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to give it to him. \n\nSay you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that\u2019s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You\u2019d say yes. Now let\u2019s say a guy you\u2019ve never met says \u201chey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I\u2019m taking the whole thing.\u201d You would say no. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I\u2019ve given people quarters to play, I\u2019ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I\u2019ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That\u2019s a nickel a day. that\u2019s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.\n\n\nEdit5: a good question:\n\n>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.\n\nNo he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.\n\nEdit6: another good question\n\n>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?\n\n\nI would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.\n\nEdit7: \n\n>INFO\nWe need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine\n\nSo this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine \"nerd\" could correct me if I'm way off base.\n\nEdit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.\n\n> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you\u2019ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.\n\nEdit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say \"your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?\"  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.\n\n1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.\n\n2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the \"you're a stupid thot\" rationalizations to come from this one). \n\n3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. \n\n4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. \n\n5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).\n\nEdit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:\n\n>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n\nEdit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit \"guest\" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.\n\n\nEdit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the \"winner\" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the \"malfunction voids all pays and plays\" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.", "First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.\n\nI got an inquiry for a group called \"Womens+ Adventures\" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.\n\nThe group wanted to work up to \"A 14er\" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.\n\nWhen I arrived for our first group hike, I learned \"Womens+\" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  \n\nThe first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. \n\nAfter we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all \"homework\" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.\n\n2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.\n\nPlease, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. \n\nI refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.\n\nAITA?", "throwaway, and I will be keeping this is Anonymous as I can, every name will be fake. \n\nmy sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, I'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. I assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked Jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if I knew the reason they broke up. I said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, I was shocked and apologized to him. \n\nthe next day I was scrolling through Facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. \n\nwith Jon's permission I posted all the screenshots on my Facebook page. \n it caused my parents to call me and tell me I have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, I've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that I'm now ruining my sisters life. \n\nAITA?\n\nedit 1 \nI've seen no proof of my sisters claims besides her word. and from what the screenshots showed she absolutely hated the fact that he was bi and wanted nothing to do with him.", "Please hear me out before you judge because while I did say what you\u2019re thinking I didn\u2019t say it in the way you\u2019re thinking.\n\nThe gym I go to is very small. Not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. This means working out fairly close to people even if you don\u2019t mean to. Yesterday I (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (One would do a set while the other waited beside them) The girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend \u201cUgh I hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.\u201d\n\nI shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. I was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s an actual well known exercise) \n\nThe same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf \u201cLook there she goes again, and her forms terrible.\u201d Which is possibly true but she pissed me off.\n\nAt this point I call her out. I said \u201cOi, you.\u201d She immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. So I called her out again specifically \u201cYou in the purple top.\u201d \n\nShe turned round and asked what I wanted. The following conversation happens:\n\nMe; Do you want to fuck me?\nHer: What?!\nMe: I said do you want to fuck me?\nHer: What the fuck is wrong with you?\nMe: Well you keep staring at me, so I\u2019m assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?\n\nShe went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. I carried on with my workout and didn\u2019t see them again.\n\nWhen I told my friend what happened, he said I acted like a dick and that as a woman I should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. He also pointed out that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. \n\nMy defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn\u2019t talk shit if she doesn\u2019t want called out on it.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m a pretty confrontational person and I could have reacted better but I also think she should mind her own business.", "Last week, I was using my sister Ashley\u2019s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend\u2019s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she\u2019s on tinder (she\u2019s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said \u201cnone of your business\u201d \n\nI decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she\u2019s just swiping for fun?) so I didn\u2019t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he\u2019d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. \n\nI created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister\u2019s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she\u2019s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. \n\nI decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could \u201chead to my place afterwards\u201d. She was completely receptive and said she\u2019d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. \n\nAfter she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for \u201cJim\u201d. My dad went up to her and said \u201cJim\u2019s not coming\u201d and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger\u2019s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. \n\nI told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a \u201cfucking dick\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who\u2019s right and if I went too far?\n\nEDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would\u2019ve had sex with Jim. That\u2019s why I went the extent that I did.\n\nAlright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I\u2019m TA. But I\u2019m TA she needed.

She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn\u2019t even have Candy Crush on her phone.\n\nSo I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn\u2019t do it).\n\nAfter dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn\u2019t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Yep, I'm reading the replies, all 3K of them, it's all very interesting.

It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?

Ex wife has BPD and life with her has been a continuous struggle. We are in the middle of a divorce because while she\u2019s lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. But she crossed that line and enough was enough. Divorce is bitter and ugly. \n\nFor financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. The both blew me off and \u201cyeah yeahed\u201d me for almost a year. Ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. Instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. Then getting mad at me when I said I had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. Since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. \n\nI\u2019ve had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future.

I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.\n\n\nMy father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a \"kid\" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they \"adults\" get out and enjoy their reunion.\n\n\nSo I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an \"adult\" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. \n\n\nWhen my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an \"adult\" this time.\n\n\nI put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a \"kid\", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.\n\n\nI got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. In their words, I am a major AH to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth.

Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they\u2019ve never don\u2019t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they\u2019ve only dated for a little more than a year. \n\nI told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.\n\nThe problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn\u2019t have to work at all during the school year. \n\nSince I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.\n\nShe now says that she\u2019s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she\u2019s not going to school, she\u2019d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.\n\nI told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she\u2019s married, I\u2019ll be happy to contribute the money. But it\u2019s not just a free handout.\n\nShe\u2019s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he\u2019s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fianc\u00e9, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.\n\nWell we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don\u2019t want her to think I support this decision.\n\nShe told me she sorta saw my point, but she\u2019s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she\u2019s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she\u2019s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?", "This has been going on for a few months now, ever since school let out.

Amazon replaced all my packages and I would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so I decided to fill a few packages with Chihuahua shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson.

You look malnourished\u201d\n\nShe kept going and now I was beginning to boil. I wasn\u2019t even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. But then I snapped.\n\nHer: \u201cGo lift some weights. It\u2019s okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cIf you could tell me what your current diet is, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll put on weight in no time.\u201d\n\n*silence*\n\nHer: \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m saying that if I\u2019m a malnourished African then you could be on The Biggest Loser. And I\u2019m pretty certain you wouldn\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cNo wonder [ex] didn\u2019t want you. Go fuck yourself.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cAnd no guy wants you. The last dick you got was Moby Dick. Fucking whale.\u201d\n\nAt this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. Her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.\n\nSince this was at Jan\u2019s place, I figured I should leave (Michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). I finished my beer and left. I got a FaceTime from one of my friends who is Jan\u2019s roommate. She urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and I went too far. I didn\u2019t feel that way and I don\u2019t want to apologize.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\nEDIT: grammar\n\nINFO: we were both drunk but I\u2019m pretty certain she had drank more than me \n\nEDIT: woah! thanks for platinum and silver you beautiful bastards! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nINFO: I was drunk so the real argument obviously had a few stumbles and slurred words. Cleaned up the text for reading purposes. ", "So, right now I'm in kinda a shitty situation. I've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. All of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but I don't feel that way, heres the story.\n\nI knew my ex for almost 10 years. We go back all the way to high school and have been friends. After we graduated I said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. We dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. I won't lie, I loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. She, however, seemed super worried. I sat down and talked with her about it. I told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy I would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. She was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.\n\nThese past 7 months have been a roller coaster. She moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. That was until a few weeks ago. An old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. I was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. This guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. Along with this, he sent me a string of Facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because I make more money that the real father and she would rather I care for it.\n\nSuffice to say, I was fucking pissed. I confronted her, she cried, I cried, it was a mess. In the end I broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born. If it is mine, i'll help her support it. If not, then I am never seeing her again.\n\nI've been cold to her. Her and her parents has tried multiple times to \"work it out\" with me but I've refused any contact with them. At one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and I kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. Any time she's tried to \"Reconcile\" i've shut it down,\n\nMy friends are saying i'm in wrong here. According to them she's pregnant and because of that I should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. I disagree fully. But I could be wrong. Am I letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?", "My mom left my dad when I was 17 (I\u2019m 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. \n\nWhen my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn\u2019t give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. \n\nSince I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that\u2019s much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I\u2019m living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. \n\nI moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we\u2019ve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I\u2019m grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. \n\nFor the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don\u2019t. She keeps telling me that \u2018even if I don\u2019t forgive her I should look out for the kids as they\u2019re innocent in all this\u2019 \n\nAITA because day to day I have no interest in helping her or her family? IMO she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. I just can\u2019t forgive her though.", "This might be a bit long but thanks for reading. \n\nI\u2019ve been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. Around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. He\u2019s not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. He\u2019s been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it\u2019s helped somewhat.\n\nTheir dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son\u2019s main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. \n\nMy daughter was graduating from college last year. A week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. I was obviously incredibly proud of her. She asked me to come to it and I said I would. \n\nHer college is two hours from here. I hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. Right as I was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. I couldn\u2019t leave, and he wasn\u2019t calm for hours. I\u2019d left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it. \n\nShe called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I\u2019d missed every game and performance she\u2019d had as a child and it clearly wasn\u2019t going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can\u2019t help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it. I\u2019ve barely spoken with her since. She didn\u2019t send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. She hasn\u2019t shown up for holidays and I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s engaged but didn\u2019t call to tell me. She\u2019s cut us out, and in the one of three times we\u2019ve spoken since she said it\u2019s easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn\u2019t have to bother getting her hopes up I might come now. \n\nAITA - I\u2019ve offered family counselling and all other manner of things. I know I wasn\u2019t a perfect mom growing up - I didn\u2019t make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. I\u2019m heartbroken but I don\u2019t think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.", "My newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. It requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. \n\nEnter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).\n\nHer kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. \n\nI tried being polite about it \"Sweetie where's your mommy?\" -points to mom- \"Ma'am!\" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says \"I don't wanna\" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. \n\n\nFinally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record \"why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that\" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. \n\nI'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. \"LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!\" \n\nPeople looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). \n\nThe last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn\u2019t want her boys to see it. \n\nNow it\u2019s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. \n\nAnyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. \n\nNow I\u2019m back she\u2019s started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I\u2019m on my period, to under the sink zipped up. \n\nI personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it\u2019s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I\u2019m living in.\n\nEdit: for more info, this isn\u2019t a random house I\u2019ve moved back into. I\u2019ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. \n\nSo this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more.", "My wife and I (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. We don't have any kids and don't want kids. We had the \"what if\" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.\n\nYesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. She's on the pill, but accidents happen. She said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. Naturally, I was surprised by the news and her change of mind. I asked her if she considered getting an abortion. She said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. She told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. She started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. She wont answer my phone calls.\n\nI'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. I was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. I know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but I can't help but have a negative view about it. A few years ago I tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but I couldn't. I was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. My wife is aware of these points.\n\nI just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. I also don't like kids. My wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows I wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. I understand why she thinks that, but I still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little I would be involved in raising him or her.\n\nAITA for asking my wife to have an abortion?\n\nEdit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. If she ever wanted to stop taking it, I would support her 100%. I realize that I\u2019m an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. It honestly never occurred to me until now (I think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). I see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. I\u2019m going to get snipped ASAP.\n\nEdit #2: She and I talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. Here are the main takeaways:\n\n* I apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. I also apologized if she felt like I was pressuring her when I asked her to have an abortion. I didn't mean to pressure her, but I know words aren't always received as we intended. She said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows I was totally caught off guard.\n* She apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. She said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes I don't feel like she tricked me (I don't).\n* We mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. We've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.", "Necessary information: When my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. After a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. Except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.\n\nThat was when my husband and I stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. I also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe thought of asking me because I had helped his brother all those years ago and it would \"basically be the same thing\". I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. Now he thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but I think I'm just being reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: While it is nice to know that I'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for \"shaming him and his wife on the internet\". I disagree as it was not my intent and I never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. He's also very mad about being called an asshole. While he is my son, I find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. I'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.", "I have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. It's fine. I can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days I can't, that's the dyspraxia). However, I won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. I only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.\n\nI'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but I still find it annoying. I really don't get why you'd think it would be an OK thing to ask someone about, but hey. I wasn't raised in a barn. Usually I nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).\n\nAnyway, I started a new job about a month ago, and I honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. I felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and I decided to make myself laugh. When the first new coworker asked about it, I completely lied and told her that I chewed them off as a baby. I then decided to tell the next person who asked that I cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that I was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. All genuinely ridiculous reasons but I'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. I didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. Maybe they just thought there's no way I'd lie about how I lost my fingers.\n\nWithin about 3 days, I learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. I'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3D printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. \n\nAnyway, I told this story to my brother today and he told me that I was an asshole because I caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. My argument is that I'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because I didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, I was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think I actually severed three fingers with dental floss when I was 3. I'll accept my judgement, though.\n\nUpdate: gonna check out here, I think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. A few reminders for people: I'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.", "Update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)\n\n   I've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. You can skip to the TL;DR if the exposition is too long.\n\nShe's a self-proclaimed \"foodie\", which I honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. She can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. \n\nIf you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' When someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.\n\n(It doesn't stop there, she knew I had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as I walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. It's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)\n\nThat's not it, either. She *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, BAM, I'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. Even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, I've saved up more being with her than I ever had in any other relationship. The only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.\n\nOur anniversary was recently, and I had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so I suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, \"I'm not learning how to make sushi because then I'll *never* get a real date ever again.\" We ended up going out instead.\n\nIt kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. She's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like Olive Garden \"because she likes the red sauce\" or other places because she likes the food, and now that I'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because I've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.\n\nShe also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste I've ever seen so I kinda think it's just an excuse.\n\nI just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.\n\nTL;DR: So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because I practically have a private chef of my very own?\n\nEdit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, I just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.\n\nEdit 2: I'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. I'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of Twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick\n\nEdit3: no, twitter, I don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. I buy her herbs and succulents. What flowers do I buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?\n\nAlso, yes, I wash the dishes\n\n#Final Edit:\n\nOkay guys. This will probably be my last edit.

My inbox is a mess.\n\nI really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and I can honestly say that I've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. It's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.\n\nSo her mom picked up the girls and I took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. She was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and I apologized for being stupid. After, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so I asked her to marry me.\n\nShe said no. She did it kindly, but she still said no. She said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. \n\nI'm pretty heartbroken. I thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.\n\nSo, Reddit, you were all right.

We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ", "I'm 99% sure I'm a megga asshole but I came here to just be sure. \n\nmy sister 23f is a megga pro life advocate, here is the stupid part, I held her hand a year ago when she got her abortion. she never mentions it and I can guarantee that I'm the only one who knew. \n\nI always feel like she is being super hypocritical because she got an easy access to have an abortion and then wants to take that away from others. \n\nI was getting sick of seeing her abortion kills babys posts and how she hates pro choice people so I decided to comment on one of her posts. I commented, you where definitely pro life when I held your had last year at the abortion clinic. \n\nI've now been blocked and she was banned from most of her pro life fb groups. \n\nAITA?", "My sixteen year old son and I went to a wedding. When we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. There was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but I never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. I sent in the RSVP card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.\n\nAt the wedding, my son and I got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. The waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. The waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.\n\nI later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that I had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. Ten and under I would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up I would never think would have a kid's meal. The bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but I've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. I think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. \n\nWIBTA if I refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? I know wedding meals are expensive, but I think this was their mistake.", "I've \\[F21\\] recently encountered a new sexual partner. We used a condom, but after words I felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time I have ever hooked up with someone I just met. My previous sexual partners have all been someone I have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. While condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a STI, it cannot provide ABSOLUTE protection. A few days ago, I noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an STD. I have never had one before and I have no idea the symptoms, but an STD was all I could think about. \n\n\nI went to an urgent care because I wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or UTI) and if not, I wanted to send my urine off for an STD screening.  My doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which I was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. \n\n\nIt came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. She says based on my symptoms, I am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and STD screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. \n\n\nAs I'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says \"Dear, will you sit down for just another moment.\" I sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. \"With all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,\". I looked at her like \"what the fuck\" and she continued \"well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,\". At this point, I was pretty fucking angry. You could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. I thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say \"you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,\".\n\nI was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn I get slut shamed for it? I posted this in a forum about sexual education and I was getting advice to report her to HR. I don\u2019t want to go after anybody\u2019s job, but I don\u2019t want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. \n\nWill I be the asshole if I report her to HR or should I leave it alone?\n\nEdit: For everybody asking, I was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. I just kind of stared at her because I immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information I shared with her so openly. So after a couple of seconds she said \u201cI appreciate your openness and honesty tho\u201d (like that mattered after anything she just said \ud83d\ude29) and opened the door for me to leave so I just said \u201cthanks\u201d and left. I was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. Trust me, I wish I would have but I wasn\u2019t even thinking about going off on her. I was just embarrassed. \n\nAlso, she was a nurse practitioner. I know a couple of times I referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was NP. \n\nAnd for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that I\u2019m having more fun than u \ud83d\ude18\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nBefore I start off with the update, I want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. \n\n1) I am not heartless, and in the original post I even directly said I did not want to go for her job. That was never my intention and I even explicitly said that. \n\n2) for ever man calling me a slut: you\u2019re obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. I also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody I just met, so \u201cclosing my legs\u201d or \u201cquit being easy\u201d doesn\u2019t fucking apply. In Game if Thrones, every single \u201cwhore\u201d had one thing in common and that\u2019s that they enjoyed sex. So if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! \n\n3) For teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. What you decide to do with your body is really nobody\u2019s business despite what other people are saying on this thread. \n\nNow to the update: \nI called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or NP supervisor. They didn\u2019t have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the NPs was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. \n\nFirst and foremost, I explained to the manager that I in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. I did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or PIP to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. \n\nI explained to her everything that happened and before I could even say who the NP was, she knew EXACTLY who I was talking about...which confirmed that she\u2019s most likely been this way towards other patients previously. \n\nI then explained how I confided in her and that I came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. I explained that her words didn\u2019t hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers AND future interactions with her other women patients. \n\nThe lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she\u2019d \u201ccall the doctor (her supervisor)\u201d right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. She also said she was placing a note and that the NP wouldn\u2019t be back in the office until next Monday. \n\nWith all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! You\u2019ve truly been so helpful. \n\nAnd for the people calling me a slut for this, I hope to God this same thing doesn\u2019t happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.", "My wife wants to quit her job. She wants to be a SAHM to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.\n\n\nIn order for her to do that, I would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on Saturdays. I told her that I if she quits her job then I expect her to cover all the housework. I may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. I will will help out on weekends but during weekdays I rather rest. \n\n\nMy wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and I am being lazy and discriminative against women. I don't really mean that, as I think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. I will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: I admit that I did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because I was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. Our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. Ofcourse, I also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.", "Throwaway. Long time lurker, first time posting. \n\nI am the oldest daughter of 4 children. I\u2019m currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. \n\nWhen I was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. I, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. \n\nThis has put a strain on my mothers and I\u2019s relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. \nShe didn\u2019t even try to keep it a secret from the kids, I remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and I\u2019d see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. As a kid I didn\u2019t understand, but as I got older I realized what she was doing in front of us and I feel sick. \n\nPeople ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this \u201cfamily friend\u201d. They split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. \n\nI\u2019ve confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. This was roughly 3 years ago. \n\nMy mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. They exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. I read the messages and it\u2019s very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she\u2019s just catching up with an old Co worker. But I know my mother, and I know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. I mean it\u2019s been years, why else would you want to catch up?\n\nMy new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn\u2019t agree with it, it\u2019s been years, he wasn\u2019t in her life yet.\n\nShe asked me what I thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. She asked for my honest opinion about the matter and I told her; \n\n\u201cTo be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy\u2019s marriage and you guys had 4 kids. Idk why you think it wouldn\u2019t ruin this one, but why don\u2019t you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?\u201d\n\nShe cried, said she couldn\u2019t believe I just called her a whore and left my house. We haven\u2019t spoken for a few days.\n\nToday, I got a call from my siblings saying I hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy\u2019s marriage was between them. I disagree, I had to witness my mom cheating on my father, I watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. She asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she\u2019s selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad?

I\u2019ve gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. We have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. They also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. It\u2019s actually turning me off sex. I find them insufferable. \n\n As petty revenge, I\u2019m considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they\u2019re loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. I feel they know I\u2019m mild-mannered, and they\u2019re taking advantage - that since I\u2019m not a tough guy or something (I\u2019m a young woman), they don\u2019t care. \n\nI\u2019m in Australia, and I\u2019m pretty sure that kind of recording is legal here.  \n\nWIBTA?", "My daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. She has been BEGGING for a Nintendo Switch. Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn\u2019t the issue... it\u2019s her behavior; she acts very entitled & she\u2019s lying left & right. I just don\u2019t feel now is the right time for a Switch.\n\nThe theft: \n\nOn Easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband\u2019s aunt & uncle\u2019s house. Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we\u2019ll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn\u2019t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.\n\nWell..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.\n\nMy kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle\u2019s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.\n\nDue to Cousin\u2019s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It\u2019s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.\n\nI\u2019m disappointed about the thievery, but I\u2019m even more upset over my kid\u2019s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn\u2019t until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. \n\nI feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter\u2019s help from money she would \u201cearn\u201d by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.\n\nI mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... BIRTHDAY... I don\u2019t really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. What do you think Reddit?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the replies. I just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. \n\nAlso - I do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a Switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. Not sure how or when, since I have a SO to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.\n\n\n\n***Edit: I\u2019ll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I\u2019m TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her \u201cno\u201d to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.", "When my wife \\[32F\\] and I \\[32M\\] got married eighht years ago, she made about 15K more per year than I did. Our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted.

I absolutely hate it because I am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.\n\nFor an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  Everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  We live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  We were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.\n\nA few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  Knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, I told my boyfriend that the event started at Noon, not 1:00.  And just as I figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  We show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.\n\nSo last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  I had lied about what time the event started.  I know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if I can lie about something like that, whose to say what else I'd be lying about.  I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if I'm 'hiding something'.  I explained that I only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  In my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.\n\nHe doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one I lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).\n\nI've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but I just have to know if I'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.\n\n\nEdit:  So I posted this before I left for work when there was only a handful of comments and wasnt able to check it all day.

Basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do I get to keep it long term. \n\nMy cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to University of Arizona so she can start next week. Either they didn't know or didn't care about the GPA requirement because when I asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. I don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 GPA. I asked her how she got into UofA and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. \n\nI basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my Grandma's will and that I will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  \n\nThat's when all hell broke loose. My mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. My sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that I'm running my own version of \"Scott's Tots\" because I taking away money that was promised for education. There's also an undertone that I'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so I can save it for myself if they don't go to college. \n\nNo amount of explanation is helping. I've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can I keep their shares. IF they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. No one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and I imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). \n\nThere is really nothing stopping me from doing it. I write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what I'm doing. \n\nI have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the Scott's Tots thing because I don't want to be seen like that. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?\n\nEdit: just for my own notes since I\u2019m saving this thread and I guess if might help other people be clear.\n\nCousin A (nieces mom), 38: paid.\n\nCousin/sister  J, 32: paid.\n\nMe: paid \n\nCousin B, 25: not paid.\n\nCousin J2, 20: in school.\n\nNiece K, 18: not paid (subject of post).\n\nA, B and K are the ones causing all the issues and calling me 30 times a day.", "My friends and I went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.\n\nWe\u2019re from England, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in Japan. It is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. I warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. They were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.\n\nI warned them multiple times that if it rains, I would not let them borrow my umbrella.\n\nOne friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. I reminded them that I would not share a few more times while we were walking. \n\nRoughly an hour later, it started raining. Hard. It was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. I stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). When we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. Neither were particularly happy.\n\nAITA for standing by my word and not saving my friend from the rain?", "I lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when TWC towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). I had no calls or texts from her, all I hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. \n\nSo for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said \"I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me.\"\n\nA few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here? I genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, I just wanted people to know what a great person my late-GF was.", "So I'm 17 and I used to be morbidly obese. I was actually morbidly obese until last year when I decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. I'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and I feel really great. I went from 130kg to 70kg and I'm 5ft 9\n\nAnyways my sister eats horribly. She is morbidly obese. My parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge Doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too \n\nAnyways I saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. The sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. My mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. It's absolutely insane I think And there was nice coke can to go with it. I told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. I offered her a Piece of tofu in which I was having for lunch. Tofu is actually delicious. More people should try it.\n\n She told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that I'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when I was a child(I wish someone did). Apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. My mother said I wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.\n\nWas I in the wrong?", "My children are 17 and 14 respectively, and I\u2019m hoping the fact that they\u2019re teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. \n\nMy husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in Canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. No one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. \n\nI had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. It was at an AA meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the US. \n\nI have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. I like to joke that I\u2019m keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. I\u2019ve had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- I am so damaged that I just feel lucky that I got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. \n\nWe had two children- two sons. We\u2019d never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it\u2019s a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. \nHe has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. \n\nMy mother in law told the kids this Sunday gone, as she decided it was \u2018time for them to know\u2019. She didn\u2019t consult us before telling them, and certainly didn\u2019t do it in our presence. \n\nSince then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they\u2019ve been prodding their dad asking why we\u2019d never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they\u2019re acting like we\u2019ve kept a secret affair family from them or something. \n\nMy 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. I broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing I\u2019d ever heard him say. I asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. \n\nHe told me that it made \u2018so much sense\u2019 why we were abnormal, why we don\u2019t drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. \n\nthe two are pretty heartbroken, and I feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children\u2019s lives as a result of us staying quiet. I am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and I don\u2019t know how to proceed. I have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news.", "My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.\n\nSince then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was going out. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\nEdit: the pregnancy was an accident but my boyfriend wanted me to keep it.", "So I\u2019m a 21 year old female. I feel like I should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out I rarely shave my legs. I\u2019m straight, I\u2019m very feminine, and I just don\u2019t like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. Also I\u2019m not a hairy person at all! You can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. The only time I shave is when I\u2019m dating a new guy in my life and I\u2019ve been with my current BF for 3 years now. Also he doesn\u2019t give a rats ass if I shave my legs. \n\nSo I work for a promotion company where I travel and work at event and festivals. But today I had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so I stoped to say hi before I left out. \n\nWhen I ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. I said sure and came in and he shut the door. He was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. I was in literal shock. I was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. My boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained I didn\u2019t shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that I wasn\u2019t being hygienic. I was even more shocked. \n\nI told him I didn\u2019t understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. I asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. I then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this I\u2019d prefer HR to be there and he just told me that we didn\u2019t need to discuss it any further. \n\nLater today I just got an email from HR saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. I\u2019m freaking out and it\u2019s making me so anxious.\nAITA for not shaving my legs for my job?\n\nEDIT: So people giving my boss hate i understand but I\u2019m not mad at him and don\u2019t blame him. Im not sure but I feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn\u2019t even force dress code and stuff. But also I really have no clue what really brought this on all of a sudden since I\u2019ve worked there 8 months with no incident.", "A very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. I\u2019ve never objected to people crossing our land as I\u2019m an avid hiker and don\u2019t want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.\n\nAnyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. It\u2019s basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. So she\u2019ll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it\u2019s a multi day hike). \n\nIt made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.\n\nNow, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. It \u201cfeels like\u201d 40-45 degrees Celsius during June-July. Today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. They said they were out of water and asked if I could refill their water bottles. I told them I could for 50cents a bottle. The reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). We aren\u2019t connected to an endless supply of water.\n\nThey were furious that I refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. I told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (I\u2019ve drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted I top them up. \n\nThey had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. So I refilled the young girl\u2019s bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. They refused and very angrily went on their way. My wife says I should have filled them up, but IMO so long as the little girl is okay I don\u2019t think they deserved anything given their attitude.", "Ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.\n\nMe and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which I pay for by myself, as I make enough money to afford it and I didn\u2019t want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend.\n \nWe also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn\u2019t want to go through that again in this one.\n\nThe fact that I pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course I pay in part for). Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n", "Context here: I'm an ex heroin addict. The why and how isn't important, but I got hooked at 15, tried to get clean at 17 but relapsed hard, finally got my act together and got off it for good at 21. I'm 26 now and completely clean. I don't even drink, except for on special occasions where I'll have two or three drinks at most.\n\nNow, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before I had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that I'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. The first year or so, I understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. However, it's been almost six years since I was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that I'm gonna stay clean.\n\nShe's very vocal about these concerns, too. If I get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks I've relapsed again and I'm having withdrawals. She made a huge scene on Christmas day two years ago because I had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that I must have been doing a ton of coke. If anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money. I mostly just grin and bear it so as not to make waves, but recently she took it a step too far. \n\nI went away recently with some friends. On the first day of my trip, I dropped and broke my phone. Because she and my brother were unable to get ahold of me for a few days, she became convinced I had gone on a massive dope bender, and began telling my family and friends that she knew this to be the case. When I got home, I found myself being given an intervention and told how disappointed people were. It was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back, and I sort of flipped at my sister in law. I yelled at her, asking why the fuck she doesn't trust me and why she's so hellbent on undermining my success and believing that I'm incapable of staying clean. She got upset and told me she was only concerned for my wellbeing, but I said imo that's bullshit; at this point it's absolutely about her not having faith in me and if she feels that way she should stay the fuck out of my business. At that point  she started crying and she and my brother left. I'm being told left and right that I'm an asshole and ungrateful because she's only looking out for me and I need to apologise, but I'm still upset that she evidently believes I'm incapable of doing this. AITA?", "Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.\n\nNow, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.\n\nLiv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.\n\nHere's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. \nWe both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.\n\nTheir relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible. \n\nOn an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.\n\nMy mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together, that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. So AITA?", "Upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. Its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). In the privacy our relationship, I playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. However, he has complained in the past about how much he hates \"locker room moments\" when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not. \n\nSo the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. One of the cues was something like, \"things that are short\" and I write down, \"my boyfriend's penis\". They were all read aloud and when its revealed that I wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. My boyfriend tries to brush it off \"oh you got me! Ha ha\" and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him \"oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro!\" more laughter.\n\nAfter we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. He said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. He said that by making that joke, all I have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. He wasn't mad, just disappointed. He said that he would never make fun of me if I had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me I was beautiful no matter what. \n\nI felt really, really bad when he said that. I have apologized and things are fine now but I think that maybe he is blowing this out of proportion? Am I the asshole or should he maybe not take this so seriously? ", "I\u2019m an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. \n\nI have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. \n\nThey get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don\u2019t need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  \n\nI used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn\u2019t give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. \n\nEven though I\u2019m a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She\u2019d obviously checked with HR and covered her ass. \n\nFor the last six months I\u2019ve been having my 30 mins \u2018meditating\u2019 out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have \u2018meditative time\u2019 and it\u2019s causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. \n\nI recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and \u2018ruining it\u2019 for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. I told her I\u2019m not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.", "First of all, I know how that sounds, but it's really not like that.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were childhood friends turned high school/college sweethearts. We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?", "So last weekend I went on a tinder date with a girl who I\u2019ve been chatting to for a while. It was our second date and I thought things were going pretty well.\n\nWe end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which I recommended. It was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. I awkwardly try to join in but I\u2019m basically ignored. I leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. They\u2019re still chatting. I stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. They back into a corner and only talk to each other. \n\nAt this point I go out and grab a smoke. She comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn\u2019t seen this guy in ages. I tell her that\u2019s cool but I\u2019m just gonna head home soon. She asks me to wait for her bc she doesn\u2019t have a ride and it\u2019s far from home. \n\nSo I wait bc whatever, night is ruined and I might as well just hang out. I wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her I\u2019m going home and she can either come with me or stay. I see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. I try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. I gesture to her that I\u2019m going and she holds up a finger like \u201cwait a minute\u201d and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend. \n\nI\u2019ve had it at this point and I just text her \u201cleaving now, bye\u201d and head straight to my car and leaves. I get frantic calls about 15 min later. She asks me where I am and if I could go back and pick her up since she doesn\u2019t have a ride and her friend doesn\u2019t live close to her like I do. I say \u201cno\u201d and hang up. \n\nAnyways the next day I get the longest, angriest chain of texts in my life. She\u2019s upset because I left her with no ride and she had to beg the bartender to call her a cab because she ran out of cash and can\u2019t get uber/lyft for some reason. She calls me a POS and to never call her again and that she\u2019ll be telling anyone she knows not to ever go on a date with me. \n\nMy roommate and his gf both agreed that the girl sucks, but they think I should\u2019ve just waited longer and made sure she got home. AITA for what I did?", "I found out I was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. When I told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if I had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. I was already living independently, both my boyfriend and I worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. In our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so I thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.\n\nDuring my pregnancy I asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when I started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when I wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when I was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. They refused, telling me that I was expecting to be catered to. They also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that I was trying to win them over and have them \"forget that I was making dumb decisions\". When I spoke to other relatives my sister \"joked\" that I was trying to get gifts from them. I had severe post-partum depression and thought I was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. My relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. They told me they were afraid I was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. Impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.\n\nWhich brings us to today, 3 years later. My sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than I did when I was treated \"as an independent adult\". Our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. Yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff I have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. Apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. I answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. I've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.\n\nSo, reddit, am I the asshole here?", "I [19M] asked a girl [18F] out to dinner. When it was time to pay, she said \"I got it\" and went into her purse. At that point I literally had the receipt thing in my hand. I thanked her and handed it to her. She hesitated a bit, but she paid and we went home happy (or so I thought).\n\nSo from my perspective I really can't see what I did wrong here. From asking her out until receiving the check, I intended to pay. After she offered to pay, I thanked her and allowed her to pay.\n\nThe next day I woke up to angry texts. She said I put her into an awkward position, forcing her to pay the bill. I asked what she wanted me to do differently. Apparently I should have argued/insisted that I would pay. My friends agree with her. Now I'm wondering if I should just apologize and pay her back.\n\nAITA?", "I want to start off by saying I love my girlfriend and I\u2019m scared that if I give her this rule or expectation it will make her feel unwelcome at my home. We have been dating for awhile now and she\u2019s always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn\u2019t eat much so I always gave her the okay. After she had spent a week at my place I told her she doesn\u2019t have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn\u2019t eat much since she\u2019s smaller but I didn\u2019t take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. She left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. I feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. I can\u2019t comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me\u2019s so often though since she\u2019s here at minimum 2 days a week. She has brought up in the past the fact that she feels I don\u2019t take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and I work 3 (not by my choice). I feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she\u2019s always making sure I\u2019m taken care of and comfortable. I don\u2019t know if I should just suck it up because she\u2019s not taking much from me and if I\u2019d be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. WIBTA?\n\nEdit: wow. I think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. My gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought \u201chaha this reminds me of me and JoyceManner!\u201d, saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. All within 20 minutes of making this post! She thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\nEdit2: to answer some repeated questions: I made this as a throwaway account. The account name is based off a pretty popular band (Joyce Manor) I like so, I didn\u2019t think she would realize it was me. I\u2019m 26 and she\u2019s 20. Her name is not Joyce. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll come on here to give her side of the story.\n\nTl;dr: I am the asshole.", "I (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nHowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nRecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nThis really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nAlso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\nOn the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. ", "My car was shaking when I braked from high speeds, my dad told me it was the rotors and I believed him but the deal I got the car from has free diagnostic so I took it there. \n\nSo my dad was right, it was the rotors. My friend had just done the brake pads like a month ago but not the rotors. So the dealer guy said it'll be 650 to get all four rotors shaved down and an oil change (synthetic oil so oil change is like 90 bucks itself). I said ok. \n\nHe calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. I asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. I specially said *do not* cut the backs ones \"do as little as possible\". \n\nHe calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so I needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. I said I told you not to cut those and he was like \"I was just tryna to help you out\"\n\n\nI'm fuming at this point, go to pick up my car. It's 750 for the two front rotors and the oil change (when they had quoted me 850 for all 4 and the oil change?!). I pay and leave. My car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. I bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed. We get into and he's like I'll do the back rotors for free labor but it's 200 for the rotors. I tell him I'll get a lawyer cause I'm not giving him literally another penny, I paid 750 for a car that's worse than before. \n\n\nI ask for the manager and eventually they agree that it was their fuck up and they'll eat the back rotors. Pick the car up the next day and it's good. \n\n\nI told my parents and they said they're proud of me but my one friend said I was a \"karen\"\n\n\nAITA?", "It\u2019s more like \u201care we the assholes?\u201d\n\nI have a twin (we\u2019re 16,M). We have identical faces, but you can\u2019t mix us up. I have long blonde hair, he has short black hair and piercings. He\u2019s bigger, like he works out. No one mixes us up. \n\nWe have known her for 2 years. She mixes our names up all the time. At least 3 times a day. We know she\u2019s doing it on purpose to annoy us. \n\nSo. Yesterday I was in living room and she called me my twin\u2019s name. I just ignored her and pretended she wasn\u2019t there. Then she called me my name and I answered her normally. My brother did the same, we did it few times. Now she\u2019s mad at us, apparently we\u2019re being extremely disrespectful and not being sympathetic because she makes \u201chonest mistake\u201d sometimes.", "My ex (24f) and I (24m) dated 5 years ago. We were together for about a year, but then she dumped me out of no where for another guy and broke my heart. She and I shared the same circle of friends so I continued to be cordial with her for the sake of our friend group, and we remained friends until we graduated and I distanced her out of my life and no longer speak to her. I'm still close with my friend group, but they have drifted from her over the past year. I'll still see her sometimes when we have hang outs with the larger group, but I no longer speak to her and we just avoid each other.\n\nThis past weekend my friend had a pre-game/party for his birthday and she was invited along with our other friends. I have a new girlfriend (23f) that I have been dating for a few months (she is absolutely amazing, drop dead gorgeous, kind hearted, thoughtful, etc. I never thought I could feel this way about someone). I invited her too, and she knew my ex would be there but was okay with it.\n\nAt the pre-game, my ex had a couple shots, was maybe tipsy. She came up to me and my girlfriend and started talking to us normally. I was kind of confused as to why, but just went with it. She then says to my girlfriend, \"Hey did you know me and Ilovepotatoes22 used to date back in the day?\" to which she says, \"Yes, I'm aware\". Ex gf smirks very subtly and under her breath says, \"Yup and he sure downgraded\" while looking me dead in the eye. My gf said \"Wow, I'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me\" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. I was angry, I truly don't believe I \"downgraded\" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes I do find her more attractive than my ex. I told my ex \"I'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. Let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again\". \n\nShe went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them I called her uglier than my current gf. I told my friends what actually happened and they understand but they told me I could have been a little bit less harsh. Ex gf is apparently really depressed and has been telling my friends that she doesn't want to come to any of the hang outs anymore. Am I the asshole?", "This has been an ongoing argument between my wife and I, but it resulted in a huge argument today and I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. I think it\u2019s impossible for someone in my position to see my wife\u2019s point of view fairly so tell me who\u2019s the asshole here. I\u2019m also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it\u2019s solely this topic/argument that I\u2019m interested in hearing your judgement on.\n\nSo my wife and I have two kids together. But before I met my wife I had a daughter with my now ex-wife. My daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. We haven\u2019t said a word to each other in almost a decade and I have no desire to speak with her anyway.\n\nI still own the same house as then and I\u2019ve pretty much left my daughters room as it was. At first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it\u2019s kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? I can\u2019t really explain the logic behind it because I don\u2019t think there is any. It just doesn\u2019t feel right to change her room.\n\nThis has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and I have really had. The house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there\u2019s my daughters old room. My kids know not to go in there and it\u2019s just left there. Occasionally I will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. It\u2019s therapeutic in some weird way.\n\nMy wife has always wanted to change the room. At first it was because she wanted a study, but I refused and eventually she gave up. \n\nWe\u2019re now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. Again I put my foot down and said that wasn\u2019t an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.\n\n She really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. She was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. She was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. She said a lot of things but I think that basically sums it up.\n\nWhen she said these things I was really hurt. But I\u2019ve had a few hours to think it over, and I think I might be the unreasonable asshole here. It\u2019s not fair to make my kids share a room because I won\u2019t let go of the past. It\u2019s not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn\u2019t my first love. \n\nAITA?", "For five years I dated a girl I\u2019ll call Mia. We got engaged last March and were supposed to get married next year, but two weeks ago I learned that our entire relationship was a lie. Someone showed me a dashcam recording of her saying that she still loves her ex and she was only with me because I\u2019m the better choice. I confronted her, she admitted it was true, I called off the wedding and broke up with her.\n\nI\u2019m determined to move past this as soon as possible and onto better things, the things that I should have achieved had Mia not wasted five years of my life. But there\u2019s an issue that has me on the fence: I was supposed to donate my kidney to Mia\u2019s brother Tom, and now I don\u2019t know if I should do it.\n\nTom has ESRD and needs a second kidney transplant as soon as possible because the kidney from his first transplant is failing. I\u2019m not that close to him and I was only going to do it because I wanted to help Mia\u2019s family in any way I could because I though they were going to be m family. But now that I know that she was just playing me the whole time, I\u2019m having second thoughts. Organ donation is a big deal, I will literally risk my life to give part of myself to someone, and at this point I don\u2019t want to do it for the brother of the girl who lied to me, used me and made me a fool for five years.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I back out?", "My MIL has made a small \"family quilt\" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.\n\nShe recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.\n\nI message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little \"break\" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.\n\nI ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says \"I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs\" verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.\n\nBut now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B\\*tch for no reason. I'm shocked because I have a great relationship with my SIL and she always defended me from other family bullshit. My husband wants no part in this now. AITA for what I said to my MIL?", "First up, I love my wife very very very much but damn does she drive crazy sometimes. I\u2019m a big dude, I\u2019m 6\u20194 and I\u2019m always goddamned hungry. I\u2019m a firefighter so I\u2019m always on my feet and simply put, I just love foooooood. My wife always eats stuff like salads and nuts but she will ALWAYS help herself to some of my food which pisses me off because it\u2019s just the right amount of food that I want to eat but she\u2019ll go ahead and take some. \n\nI\u2019ve asked her so many times to leave my food alone and she\u2019ll get really defensive and say \u2018it\u2019s just a little babe, you\u2019ll be fine!\u2019 Except I\u2019m not fine, I\u2019m hungry. And then when I\u2019m hungry I get hangry and I snap at everyone cuz I\u2019m goddamned hungry!\n\nThings came to ahead at our kids 3rd birthday party. Wife said no to cake, despite me bringing over a slice\nto her, so I gave that slice to my cousins kid who was on his second slice. my girl ended up eating the whole slice whilst I held the goddamn plate and then when I went to get myself some all the cake had finished.\n\nLately my MIL gave me the idea to just spice my food to stop my wife from taking mine, since she can\u2019t stand spicy food.  I tried that yesterday, I ordered pizza and asked my wife if she wanted one. She said no. I went ahead and got pepperoni and jalape\u00f1os, and predictably when it came she came over and got all mad because it was spicy and she couldn\u2019t eat it.\n\nI told her I had to take drastic measures because I\u2019m fed up of sharing my food and she called me a selfish asshole. \n\nWho\u2019s TA here?", "I\u2019m really upset with my wife after what she\u2019s done, but everyone of our friends/family thinks she is right to do what  she did. So I\u2019m posting here to get an unbiased perspective.\n\nI\u2019ve been married to my current wife for three years. We dated for 2 years before getting married. Before meeting my current wife I had been married to my \u201chigh school sweetheart\u201d for well over a decade.\n\nMy late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. It was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and I didn\u2019t start dating again for several years after the fact. I never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.\n\nI\u2019ve always had a momento from my previous marriage. It was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. She gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. Before meeting my current wife I would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.\n\nWhen I met my current wife she wasn\u2019t comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. So I started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it\u2019s an extremely important item to me. For a time she accepted that until recently.\n\nOver the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she\u2019d bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding I get rid of it. I can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but I had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... Why can\u2019t she accept it\u2019s very important to me?\n\nLong story short, when I was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. When I found out I broke down because it was literally the last thing I had to remember my late wife.\n\n I don\u2019t know. Maybe I am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. AITA?\n\nEdit: when I say ex-wife I mean late wife. We never divorced.", "My GF and I were out at a club to see a DJ. We were dancing, drinking, having a good time. My GF has been doing yoga for a few years and when she\u2019s especially sauced she likes to throw in some splits and stuff on the dance floor. Well, we got sauced and as she\u2019s doing her 3rd split or so a guy comes up and \u201cmakes it rain\u201d on her - literally like 4 dollars. Obviously he was making a joke that she was dancing like a stripper. Whatever. This happened and in the moment I just fucking started laughing. I thought it was legitimately funny in the moment. My girlfriend gets up and says \u201cwe\u2019re fucking leaving\u201d and basically storms out. Get outside and she\u2019s basically telling me that I should\u2019ve punched the dude out or something and that he made her feel like a whore and I\u2019m an asshole for laughing. I\u2019m fucking 31, I\u2019m not punching anyone out at a bar unless they\u2019re actually getting physical or threatening to get physical. While I agree that it might\u2019ve been somewhat demeaning, I also think it was objectively funny. AITA?", "Lots and lots of ugly background here but I'll try not to wander. My wife I have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in May. I have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. \n\nOn Monday I came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. I asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. They said they were playing army and since I've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, I knew their parents wouldn't mind either. So I told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case I needed him to come down. I was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. So they did this every day this week until Thursday when my daughter came home from her CIT job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if I was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing Army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and Aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. I climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where I assume the girl had usually sat. I told my son to knock it off and he said he would. \n\nThis morning I got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would \"confront\" me and my son Saturday morning. We sat down and it went from a calm \"this is something we're concerned about\" to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an \"adolescent sex ring\" in a matter of seconds. I tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and I've gotten them to stop. My wife asked if I planned on punishing him, I said that I don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. My neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. I told her that was really overkill. My wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and I asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. My wife has texted me that I am being incredibly irresponsible and if I don't do \"something\" she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. In all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend! \n\nI guess that's about it...but am I the asshole for how I'm handling the issue with my son?", "Sounds bad, but going to preface this by saying I\u2019m not tryna get pregnant without my husbands consent \n\n\nI went to the doctor yesterday because I\u2019ve been super emotional and my body has been out of whack and my doctor was basically like \u201cWe gotta get this implant out of you\u201d (I had nexplanon, the implant in your arm) and I decided to give my body a break from hormones and to use condoms/ other methods for the time being because I don\u2019t want to conceive.\n\n\nI call my husband and tell him and he\u2019s like \u201cOh ok did you get on the pill?\u201d And I said no, I didn\u2019t want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said I need to be on birth control because it\u2019s the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced I\u2019m like trying to get pregnant without his consent. Should I have called and discussed this with him since it effects him too (as in he has to wear a condom)\n\nETA: if I hadn\u2019t of taken it out yesterday, I would have to wait a month because that was my gynos my next available appointment. So it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to consult my husband, it was kind of a quick decision.\n\n\nETA #2: I have a fucked up cervix so I can\u2019t have an IUD, can\u2019t use tampons, lots of stuff.\n\n\nETA #3: I believe now he is the asshole; it\u2019s not normal for a husband to react this way, and he kinda sucks anyway. Thank you for the support and the judgement (even the dude who messages me I was basically just a sex doll)", "So, i\u2019m 24M. My little sister is 14 and has always been interested in art. I moved an hour and a half away when I was 18 and we \ndon\u2019t see eachother often, but I make a point to call/text\n\n\nIt was her birthday yesterday and I thought I\u2019d splurge since she\u2019s been going through a rough time. She\u2019s changed schools twice due to bullying and our mom always tells me that she won\u2019t talk to anyone, is having intense mood swings, etc. I\u2019ve made multiple attempts to help her, but she shuts me down and gets snippy.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I got her a set of 150$ artist grade markers called Copics. I\u2019m no art connoisseur, but apparently every artist who\u2019s anybody has them and our parents don\u2019t wanna spend that kind of money for her hobby (they\u2019re about 5$ PER MARKER) and tend to give practical gifts like clothes. Whenever we\u2019ve texted recently it\u2019s been her ranting about them not getting them for her.\n\neven on her birthday she was like a bomb about to go off. She barely acknowledged me and only said hello when she was asked. I was excited to give her the gift but the second I opened it she grabbed them and turned to our mom, saying \u201cSee! Even he knows you should\u2019ve got them for me!\u201d Which I awkwardly brushed off. Everytime she opened a gift from our parents it was very snotty like \u201cOh, yayyyy, cheap sneakers, my favorite.\u201d \u201cA plaid skirt. WOW. I\u2019m blessed.\u201d \n\n\nI was prepared for an angsty teen, but I soon reached my limit. Our dad showed her a journal they bought and she suddenly yelled \u201cI told you both exactly what I wanted but you spent the same amount of money on shit I don\u2019t need! Fuck this!\u201d she threw it against the wall and ran up to her room.\n\n\n\nOur parents were a lot less well-off when I was her age, and they could barely afford a birthday for me. Everytime it was a dodgy cake and a handful of clothes without holes in them, I accepted them like I was the luckiest kid ever. I would\u2019ve never swore and yelled but she\u2019s been very spoiled.\n\n\nI talked with them for awhile and apparently shes done worse before which shocks me. They think even if they can afford it now, she should learn the value of a dollar. I agree helped shape me to not have my every whim be attended to. Besides, she got what she wanted in the end, why is she still mad in the first place?\n\n\nSister came back to get the markers, but I took them back. I said that she was ungrateful and I wouldn\u2019t tolerate it. She started screaming at me but I just left the \u201cparty\u201d prematurely with the gift in tow.\n\n\n\nMy whole family is blowing up my phone because I \u201cruined her birthday\u201d. In my eyes, I spent 150$ to get no thank-you and yelled at. This will teach her a valuable lesson and maybe spark a change in her teen angst phase. But my family doesn\u2019t want to hear from me until I give it back. Considering I\u2019ve got my entire family shitting on me, I have to wonder if I did make the wrong choice. So, reddit, AITA?", "My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. We have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. I wouldn't call myself a \"peak bagger\" but I do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when I can. BF doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. \n\nFor reference, I am a 5'3\" 150lb woman. He is a 5'7 170lb guy. \n\nOn Sunday I went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. If you're familiar, it's 13er James Peak in CO. It was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). I had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. Suffice to say, I was pretty hungry by dinner time. I made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. When it came time to eat, because of my big day, I grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. We're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. \n\nBF got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. He told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. I told him that I'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. \n\nHe told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. I said that I agreed, but again, I'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. He told me I should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. \n\nWe've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). So far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. I think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general. \n\nAITA? Is this just really dumb?", "The other day at work, an 80-year-old woman said \u201cCongratulations. You have got one coming on the way. Mazel tov\u201d and reached her hand toward my belly. I moved away from her, yet she still managers to reach her hand and pat my belly. I was annoyed, so then I touched her belly and repeated it back to her, and then she got mad. People should not touch either men\u2019s nor women\u2019s bellies without permission, but it was also wrong that she made fun of me for being fat. AITA?", "I am a librarian at a prek-12 school. I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\nEdit: thanks for your responses everyone, especially those of you PMing me telling me to kill myself or that I\u2019m an emotional bitch who should listen to the logical men or I will die alone :)))))) love u all", "Update 2: I told my ex to cancel her vacation as my son will not be going because it affects my custody time. Yes, I told her it was okay but after her husband's stunt of saying he couldn't do the sleepover which was on my day anyways, I had to crack the whip. Let those two eat each other alive. They deserve each other.\n\nUpdate 1: This HILARIOUS. My son's best friend mom emailed us an invite for a sleepover which is on my DAY. I was going to see if my son wanted to go, but my ex's husband said my son could not go as he was grounded. I can react in so many ways...\n\n\nHis mom and I are divorced and don't have much of a relationship. Cordial, but indifferent. Our son is now 11 and my ex remarried a few years ago but she was with the guy for some time.\n\nWe have 50/50. She requested that she have him for two weeks for vacation. I agreed even though this ate into my time with him. Apparently, he got into it with step dad and he got grounded for a week. Well, most of that week is my week with him before he leaves for vacation with them and she asked me to see to it that his grounding continues through my time. I won't see him for three weeks. I am not saying not to punish him. \n\nPunish him when he's on their time. \n\nI have no problems with him when he's with me.\n\nI refused.\n\nI already made plans to make most if the days that I have him and I'm sure as hell am not going to cancel those plans because he mouthed off to step-dad. I don't care much for step-dad anyways. What I do with my son on my time is my business and vice-versa. \n\nAlso, I don't want to set precedent where I am the parent who has to do both sides of discipline.\n\n\nEdit: Update: My son called him a \"freaking asshole.\" My ex calls him the same thing when they fight. Her words, not mine. He learned it from her, not me. I don't open share my dislike for her husband. Maybe an eyeroll, but I'm too corporate and professional to do it in front of my son.", "Throwaway account.  We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the \"mom\" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for \"dad\" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.\n\nBut as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so. \n\nMy husband said that it was a crappy thing for me to do. I feel like I was protecting the restaurant. Was I the Asshole?", "So I'm pretty pissed off right now. My son is 3 and goes to a pre k program with some kids upt age 5. Today they had a nice Easter egg hunt. I had to work today so I couldn't attend but they asked each kids parent send at least 14 eggs for the hunt. I love school functions like this. I wish I could have been there. So we sent some extra eggs with him and some cupcakes. His father got there late. Well he just texted me saying he didnt get one damn egg. The bigger kids just steam rolled the smaller kids and all had 30+ eggs each. He said he got there right when they started and our son was pushed over by the bigger kids and just started crying. He didnt get a single egg. The teachers didnt supervise this at all. I'm not saying he needed a lot of eggs, but one fucking egg. Hes the only kid with no eggs. My SO said they're now sitting there our so  is crying as all the other kids are opening eggs. I'm beyond pissed they didnt supervise this better. I need to know of I'm over reacting before I call up there and just let them have a piece of my mind.", "My brother (26/M) has a one year old son with a woman he was never in a relationship with, apparently they were friends with benefits. \n\nLong story short she got pregnant, he wanted her to abort and she refused, she had the baby, he got a DNA test confirming he\u2019s the dad, now he pays child support. They share custody. \n\nI had dinner with him the other day and as usually he bitched about how child support is unfair, etc. I told him for the first time that it\u2019s his fault. He chose to have sex knowing the risk of pregnancy. He got mad and said it\u2019s not fair because women can abort but men can\u2019t, I told him he knew that before he has sex with her but he still risked it. He called me an asshole, but I was just being honest.\n\nEdit it:\n\nI just woke up and I\u2019m surprised at all the hate messages I\u2019ve gotten from other guys. I AM A MAN. So many of the hate messages assume I must be a woman because I believe in sexual responsibility. Wtf is wrong with men today... this shit is weird.", "\n\nSome background: My grandfather just passed away at the end of January. He was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. \n\nThis is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. His only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. But to my huge surprised I was named as his sole heir with life changing money. With the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. \n\nHere's where it gets even stickier. My mom passed away 6 years ago. She had one sister who I was fairly close to and from her I have 3 cousins. I don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was \"it's between the two of them.\" I have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and I don't know if they ever met him. To be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like I did. Cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral I set up for my grandpa either. \n\n\nNow she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that I split the estate 5 ways. \n\nThis is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:\nNo matter what I shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. If I do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. Both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. \n\nI can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as \"enough\" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. The first attorney strongly advised I do this. \n\nI do nothing. I am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. This is my second attorney's preferred course of action. \n\nBut this is not about the legality of the situation. This is about what SHOULD I do and would I be the asshole if I keep the entire estate for myself. Just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. I have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. I could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. \n\nBasically, WIBTA if I don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?", "My son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\n\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\n\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\n\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\n\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\n\nAITA?", "I know how the title sounds, hear me out. My \\[26M\\] gf \\[24F\\] takes forever in the bathroom. Upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?\n\nI understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves.\n\n**Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes.\n\nHe rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair.\n\n**Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.\n\n**EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, \"in stained shirts and greasy hair\". Jesus. The amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that I'm not TA and the Reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man.\n\nI think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. As I said before, this was never a fight. And for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me I can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight.\n\n**EDIT 2 (from gf):** Thank you, Reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. He let me shave his legs. He said he feels like a dolphin. I've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (I didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)", "So, this is a little strange of a situation but hear me out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. I love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. She is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  I will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). One of her big beliefs though is with holidays. She still celebrates holidays with the family (Christmas, Easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the \"Money\" side of things. We're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for Christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.\n\nLast year in June my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. Her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. I was a little hesitant but I agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.\n\nWell, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. All of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. I obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. All of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. She's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. We fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm i being unfair here?", "My daughter has recently turned 16 and, for a couple of months now, has been constantly asking for a lock to be put on her door.

About a year and a half ago, we were just chilling at her place.

I knew she Reddits but the first thing that came to my mind was \u201cMan, she has to be a karma whore to the extreme; what the fuck does she comment on?\u201d So I went to her profile when I discovered, oops, that was her NSFW account.

It took a bit of digging, but I managed to find her account again, and spanked it to her. Ever since, I pretty much regularly masturbate to her. It\u2019s not that I want to have sex with her, BUT she is hot, and the taboo nature of looking at someone I knew kept it alluring.\n\nAnyways, I majored fucked up when hanging out with her today. Her boyfriend\u2019s birthday was coming up, and she asked what she should give him. Like an idiot, I answered \u201cyou should give him a strip tease with those fishnets you have.\u201d IDK why the fuck I said that; I had fishnets in my head because I spanked it that morning, and I forgot to realize that it was actually HER who posted a picture of herself in fishnets a couple days ago. She asked \u201chow did I now she had fishnets\u201d and I tried to just say I was joking, but I eventually admitted I knew her NSFW account.\n\nShe asked for how long and I was honest; for the better part of a year. She was **furious**.  She said those pictures are private pictures, and that they were not meant for my eyes. In all honesty, I think she\u2019s being kind of ridiculous. How are you posting pictures of yourself online, then you\u2019re mad that people jerk off to the pictures you post online?\n\nI apologized for hurting her but maintained that SHE posted those pictures, and I just happened to find them (I didn\u2019t mention I found them on her computer, but to my defense, she does have some identifying markings and a couple pictures where she shows most of her face; if she was trying for anonymity, she did a shit job). She said if I found her account, I should\u2019ve just pretend I didn\u2019t, and that she feels gross and violated and she wanted me to leave.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m going insane. If they were on her phone or something, I\u2019d *completely* understand, but she invited herself to be jerked off to by the pictures she posted. Was I really unreasonable in jerking off to publicly posted pictures?\n\nEDIT so I feel the need to explain that she wasn\u2019t bothered by the \u201csexual\u201d undertones in the joke at all. That\u2019s just how we joke around, and if it wasn\u2019t for the the fact that she just posted the fishnet pic, she would\u2019ve laughed it off because that\u2019s just how our relationship is. Also I\u2019ve realized I now fucked up. I\u2019m going to talk to her.\n\n\u2014-\n\n**HUGE UPDATE**: So I tried calling her. She understandably didn\u2019t answer, so I  decided to text her a huge apology instead. I also decided to call her boyfriend to apologize to him personally. To my surprise, he did pick up. I told him that I was sorry about everything and I\u2019ve crossed some serious boundaries and that I\u2019ll step away from the friendship if it\u2019d make him comfortable. \n\nWell, he was completely confused and asked me to clarify. I told him that I figured my friend told him what happened, but the gist was that I found her NSFW account and hid it from her, and I violated her trust and I\u2019m sorry. \n\nWell, he had absolutely NO idea what NSFW account I was talking about. So I sent him a link and he was dumbfounded. *He didn\u2019t know the account existed*. I had no idea; I just assumed because they were dating, she\u2019d of course tell him. \n\nHe appreciated the fact that I told him, and he views as what she did as cheating, and confided is me that he\u2019s going to break up with her.  I feel horrible for causing all of this drama. I\u2019m a shit friend, and most definitely lost one of the best I\u2019ve had, even if she was cheating. \n\nAh well; life moves on. Here\u2019s to a better tomorrow\n\n\n\u2014-\n\n\nLAST EDIT because I\u2019m getting a lot of replies \n\nI didn\u2019t tell him to hurt her. Like I said, I was planning on stepping away from the friendship. Which is why I said above \n\n>\tI\u2019ll step away from the friendship if it\u2019d make him comfortable. \n\nI told him because I assumed he knew about the NSFW account. You know, because they\u2019re monogamous? And posting your naked body regularly on Reddit is typically something you tell your monogamous boyfriend. \n\nPeople are asking why I felt the need to apologize to him and not her. You just didn\u2019t read the damn post. I tried apologizing to her. I called her. She didn\u2019t answer. So I texted her instead. \n\nI just decided that IN ADDITION, I was going to apologize to him. Because I disrespected their relationship. \n\nI was asked \u201chey, why didn\u2019t you rat her out a year ago?\u201d\n\nBecause you numb-nuts; I DIDNT KNOW THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE NSFW ACCOUNT. Why would I think she\u2019s hiding a NSFW porn account from her boyfriend? That\u2019s CLEARLY something you tell your SO. Jesus fucking Christ. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to break them up. I wanted to apologize because I was told by 300 people that I\u2019m a piece of shit. I tried, and I just made it worst. \n\nBut it WASNT malicious. Period. And at the end of the day, she was (either by omission or explicitly) lying to him about this account. That\u2019s not okay in a monogamous relationship, and she deserved to be called out. \n\nI\u2019m NOT saying I\u2019m not TA. On the contrary, I\u2019m a huge piece of shit. Keep calling me a piece of shit; I deserve it. \n\nBut stop saying I did this to hurt her. Stop saying I did this to ruin her relationship. I fucked up. I know. But none of this was malicious. None. \n\nI\u2019m signing off for the night.", "Title is pretty self explanatory. But basically over the weekend, I had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. She\u2019s babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. Well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. She gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. Things happen and somehow it got knocked over.\n\nHer laptop no longer switches on. She\u2019s blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. I told her no as it shouldn\u2019t have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. She\u2019s refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she\u2019ll never babysit for me ever again. I really don\u2019t feel as though it\u2019s my responsibility.. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Yikes this blew up. A few people have asked for more info. Yes, I packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. I supplied everything he\u2019d need for the weekend - including nappies and food. My parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she\u2019d be able to spend time with him. It wasn\u2019t just \u2018babysitting\u2019 but more enjoying time with her nephew. I gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as \u2018payment\u2019 for watching my son. Every other time she\u2019d had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach.", "Jump into the worst week of my life. I was with my ex fianc\u00e9 for 6 years. Loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for August. Refused a job offer so could move with him for his next Air Force assignment. Monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) I text back she must have wrong number. She says she doesn't. In a moment of brains I pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. I'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. \n\nI confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. I consider it for half a second and say no. Cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of STD tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who I loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. \n\nAnd on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. Groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. Bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll \"make it up to me.\" \n\nI've never hated a human being as much as I hate him. I can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. I understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because I'm upset. so I just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. \n\nWoukd I be the asshole if I back out of the wedding?\n\nEdit: wow I checked out for a few hours to try and sleep and this exploded. I\u2019m so sorry I haven\u2019t been reading I\u2019ll try and catch up\n\nEdit 2: ok guys I don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or NTA and said I should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. I'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from \"Panama\" where she said \"remember, you liked tounging my asshole?\" so when I get sad I have an instant reminder of who he really is. And then when it's all over I'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. If I can update a week from now I will. I still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.\n\n\nEdit 3 (that wont be seen): guys I've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3AM last  Monday (or Tuesday, or whatever). I have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. That just isn't the case, at all. I love her as much as I love any person on the planet and she has my back. But this wedding is now a week away. It's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fianc\u00e9 not to come. Everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. My ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. He's as close with the groom as I am with her. If they make big changes now then the day becomes about what HE did, not about the wedding. It's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like I said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. If I bring that up then this whole week becomes about THAT. My best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. They didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. My friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fianc\u00e9 to walk in with other people or even separately, but I'm not going to do that. First of all because I think it will look weird. And secondly I foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him ONE LAST TIME--FOREVER and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come August but he fucked it up.", "My four year old has decided to become a picky eater. He doesn't have autism or anything else that causes sensory issues, he's just picky now, he used to be willing to eat anything. If he had his way he'd only eat french fries and Goldfish. Obviously I'm not going to let him only eat those two things. I'm also not going to be bossed around by a toddler. What I've been doing is that if he turns up his nose at a meal, I'll just say something like \"Alright, I guess you can eat this later\" and put the food in the fridge. If he asks for a snack, I offer him the food, and if he refuses, no snacks except for milk; at the next meal, I'll offer it to him then if he didn't eat it before. He carries on for a bit, but he eventually gets hungry enough that he'll eat whatever it was he was refusing to eat before. He's never gone more than a day of refusing to eat, if he did I'd probably feed him something else. My mom friends are horrified I'd do this to my kid, and tell me I'm old fashioned. I also feel like the worst mother in the world when my kid is whining about how hungry he is. For the record my husband is completely on board with this method.

I feel like I have no other choice but to be strict because if I'm not he'd have me serving him an unhealthy diet.\n\n\\-I don't want him to grow up thinking he's entitled to order me or anyone else to cook special meals for him.\n\n\\-I do season my food and cook it in other ways besides steaming or boiling.\n\n\\-I would never let him not eat for a long time like some of you have described.

", "Married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  In our second year of marriage my wife went home when I was deployed and slept with Some Dickhead (who I'll refer to as SD from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  She hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  SD and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason I didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after I got home.  And she didn't try to justify it with the \"oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah\".  No she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though I agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe immediately cut off all contact with SD and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from SD's mother that SD died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like I got kicked right in the dick.  I instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. All those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  The pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  She keeps saying shit like \"it's the right thing to do\" and \"she just wants to pay respects\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't stop repeating that I'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and I'm re-living all those shitty nights I was sure our family would be shattered and I would only see my daughter 50% of the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter some back and forth I put my fucking foot down and told her NO, she cannot go.

That is not the case, I am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together.\n\nEDIT 2: I apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as SD, because that's what he was.  Fuck 'im.\n\nA lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean I have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point I can see myself walking away if she insists on going.

She was all too happy to give him the number and they hug with a kiss on the cheek before he leaves. \n\nAt this point I was just over it. I wasn't that interested in her and if she's the type of person to show interest in another guy and exchange info in front of me I have no future with her.\n\nI decided to make up some random excuse to get away from her and just got in my car and drove home. I didn't want to have to deal with her company for a 40 minute drive and was over it. \n\nOh well, I honestly feel like a bit of an asshole, but also feel it was just in a sense considering what happened....", "My wife and I had a pretty normal marriage. No kids, both employed and really happy together. For 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. \n\nShe recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. The first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. Dinner went well, came home and went to bed. Wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. Long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after I had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.\n\nWe talked, yelled, cried. I spent most of the night sick. Told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. I've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.\n\nBefore this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. Turns out we were wrong, as I was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. I got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. She was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. I told her I wished her all the best, I'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while I'd help financially from a distance, I wasn't physically going back.\n\nThey (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. My own friends are split 50/50. I don't want to go back. Before anyone pulls the \"this is probably why she cheated!\" card, no. We had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. We were solid. She just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. She never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. While I certainly don't think anyone deserves this and I am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. I feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing I won't forgive her when it's over. It feels like prolonging the inevitable, and I feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. She has family and friends so she isn't alone. I care about the woman I thought I married, but I no longer love who she turned out to be, so I feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. I'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. AITA?\n\n**Edit**: To the reddit detectives further down. When I said \"we talk every month\" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. We talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. Secondly, I mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when I was told I didn't believe it, I figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment I left. I also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. As far how she cheated the \"entire\" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. And I figured this would be easy to figure out but I guess not, I knew her friend forced her to tell me because I demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. Finally, I know a lot of people post made up stories. I'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details I can't prove it. If I wanted karma I wouldn't be on a throwaway, I posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable I think it's time for neutral third party judgement and I was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided. To the mods, I'm sorry this post wasn't a great fit here. I'll post in the appropriate subs in the future.", "My grandmother passed earlier this year and she had a pretty nice jewelry collection. Before she passed she knew what went to who and had had me meet to see what I\u2019d like. Instead of jewelry I asked for her wedding dress. No one else wanted it, I had gotten married in it, and she was really touched. After talking to her kids she went ahead and gave it to me before passing. \n\nWhen she did pass away I was surprised she hadn\u2019t written down who got what pieces. Since I had already passed on inheritance of a piece I didn\u2019t go to the meeting with the rest of the family. Basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. From what I heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. \n\nSince I wasn\u2019t there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. It was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. It was sweet of them to do that, so I could have a piece of her everyday too. \n\nWhen I got the ring I didn\u2019t examine it. It was big enough I thought it was fake too. But then I saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating Leo diamonds). I took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. It\u2019s value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). Essentially I got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. But they chose it for me. \n\nNow, they want to redo the distribution. But I feel like it\u2019s fair. I didn\u2019t ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. AITA if I refuse?\n\nEdit to add INFO:\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone.

I have a second grader who I have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. \n\nShe came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more \"appropriate\" snacks and lunches. I thought for a minute that maybe I accidentally grabbed one of my Quest Bars or something for her and asked my daughter.\n\nFor her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. My daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, I put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. The teacher commented on it.\n\nLunchtime came around, and I guess a similar thing happened. My kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week I made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. Her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and I guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. This is what sparked the note. \n\nSo I explained that she shouldn't share \"spicy\" foods with her friends, and figured I'd skip the pickles next time. Well, it wasn't good enough. Just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send \"age appropriate\" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a PB & J, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.\n\nI called the teacher and asked her about the note. Teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is \"a little kid\" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating \"adult food\" yet. I asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said \"No\" and \"This really shouldn't be a big deal.\"\n\nThis might be where I fucked up. I told the teacher that I'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. That when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, I will continue to send my kid to school with the foods I pick. Teacher got huffy and hung up. \n\nJust to double check, I asked my daughter two things: Does she LIKE her lunches? (Enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and \"Are the other kids making fun of you?\" because I know that can be an issue. She said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. \n\nSo AITA, or is this teacher way out of line?", "Hi AITA.

I'll try and answer some of the things I have seen asked most often here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1: I feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that I have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. To put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, I was a victim of CSA for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. It led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that I struggle with to this day (I never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that I've done that I'd like to not have spread around). She has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2: By all of her friends and family, I meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. I worded that terribly. I have not been in the best headspace as of late. Sorry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3: We have not spoken since. I have no desire to speak to her ever again. My coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and I have not heard anything from him. As petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all I care. I have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. Maybe I am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. I feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4: I will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. I have the money to fight a legal case if I have to, though obviously, I would rather not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyeah. that pretty much the main things I wanted to clear up. I'll go through the thread tomorrow if I feel up to it and see if there's anything else. It's a bit of a shitshow and I'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm", "My son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. He is only 17 and she is 16. I told him I was proud that he came forward to tell me, but I didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. Both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. According to him, having a child is \"easy\" and not \"really that hard\". We tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.\n\nSince then, the house has been quite tense. Any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. I have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. Since my son told us they were pregnant, I have done the following:\n\n1. I wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. I open the door, scream as loud as I can until I know he is awake, and I shut the door. I've done this 5 nights in a row.\n2. I purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. I have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, I shut off the internet until he changes it. I will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.\n3. While playing one of his games, I told him his \"baby\" wanted to be held. Giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. I placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. While he was doing this, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. I told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.\n4. I have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. When he presses me for a reason, I tell him \"You dont have a babysitter. You can go if you take your sack of flour with you.\" He has not gone anywhere in a week.\n5. Yesterday, I did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. I told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. This was the last straw for him.\n\nAfter his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. He told me I am being completely unrealistic. I reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything I have done so far he has done to me in the past.\n\nHis mother tells me I am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but I don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. If anything, I want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.\n\nTell me the truth; Am I being too much of an asshole here?", "I am 24M and I have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. She is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back.\n\nLast week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down. \n\nToday, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.\n\nWhen I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my \"friend\" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want?\n\n**EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed...\n\nBut the part where she says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she\u2019ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**", "My family is Asian, my husbands side is white.\n\nMy husband and I got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our \u201creal\u201d one. \nWe were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. My husband and I took the villa.\n\nThe bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. We made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. \n\nOur villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. \n\nWe have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. During dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. My grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. \n\nWell, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to \u201cslave\u201d and live as \u201cpeasants\u201d while their grandchildren get a nicer room. \n\nThis is bora bora we\u2019re talking about. No one is living as a peasant here. \n\nThere was only 1 villa available in our section. Had I given it to my grandparents I think it would\u2019ve been offensive to my husbands grandparents. If there was 3, we would\u2019ve given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. But unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t. I mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.\n\nI obviously objected, and said I felt as though my husband and I should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate OUR marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? Wouldn\u2019t one just sit back and be grateful they\u2019re on a free vacation instead of complaining?\n\nMy grandparents freaked out. Saying I\u2019m holding money above their head and that I\u2019m being disrespectful and not following their orders. They stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. \n\nIdk what to do. My side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and I agree. They are so ridiculous. All I wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it\u2019s falling apart. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole at all, but I\u2019ve been up all night thinking wether I should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. But another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. \n\nSo Reddit, what do I do? WIBTA if I denied giving up my villa?\n\n\n\n***UPDATE***\nEven though I really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, I decided it\u2019d be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that I was disrespectful.\n\nDuring breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if I was there. Everyone tried calling them-nope we\u2019re not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. After a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. \n\nI made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. They said they hadn\u2019t looked yet and that should be my job if I was kicking them out?? I made sure they knew I was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. \n\nThey kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. Every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. \n\nWell, I\u2019m not doing that. \nI\u2019ll pay for their flight back home, but I\u2019ve already done enough accommodating on MY honeymoon vacation. \n\nSo there you have it. My grandparents weren\u2019t even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. I called their bluff. \n\nAfter breakfast, I found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. They also didn\u2019t get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. \n\nStaff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. Im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. My cousins came over and honestly couldn\u2019t care less my grandparents are gone, in their words \u201cthey kill the vibe\u201d. So everyone\u2019s happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. \n\nI\u2019m happy I was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. \n\nI have an overflow of messages and comments, that I can\u2019t get back to. However, the main question is what my profession is. \n\nI did not go the usual Asian route. I actually dropped out my last year of college and started a fashion line that took a couple years to take off, but surprisingly sky rocketed a few years ago. My dad is also an entrepreneur, I looked up to him and am so glad I had him as an inspiration who paved the way. Don\u2019t give up on your dreams, you guys.", "My wife stays in contact with her ex who she dated for 5 years before meeting me. All they do is text each other occasionally, which I have no problem with. I explained to her early on that I am not interested in ever meeting or befriending any of her exes. She agreed and it was never an issue until now.\n\nHer ex has moved back to the city where we live and she really wants him and I to meet. Once again I explained to her that I have zero interest in such a meeting. I see no point to it, I don't need his blessing or approval, and I have enough friends. Plus the whole idea just seems awkward. \n\nShe explained that it would mean a lot to her if I would just meet with him. I asked why and her response was that it will keep his mind at ease knowing that she is with someone good. I snapped a little but didn't raise my voice and asked her: *\"Since when does his wants and concerns matter in our marriage?\"* \n\nShe didn't have answer for this and simply asked me to think about it. I know my answer is not going to change and I am honestly quite angry about this whole thing. AITA? Also any advice is much appreciated.\n\nThank you.\n\n**P.S**\n\nI don't care if they meet occasionally to catch up, but I think I'll be getting a divorce if they start hanging out on the regular. I love my wife but I don't think I have her heart. He was her longest relationship aside from me and she lost her virginity to him.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nWith regards to divorcing her over this:\n\n> I'd rather divorce her than control her. I didn't tell her that I would do this, it will simply happen. I can control what I do (not meeting him), but I cannot control what she does. It would be better to part ways instead of turning the marriage into a toxic swamp.", "My brother is 18. He has a 15 year old girlfriend. Age of consent where he lives is 16. They are both in highschool, he is a senior, she is a junior.\n\nTo my knowledge, he is still a virgin. He does know the basics about sexual health, pregnancy, prevention, and STD prevention. Another thing my mother and I butt heads about but she gave in on that one.\n\nMy mother refused to talk to him about the fact that if they were to engage in a sexual relationship, it would be illegal in my home state. She said he is innocent and he's not sexually active. It wasn't necessary. I implored her to change her mind because things can progress very quickly and he needed to know.\n\nLast night I called my brother and discussed it with him myself. I didnt try to scare him, just gave him facts. He also told me they haven't done anything yet. I told him that if sex was something they are considering, they should wait until after her birthday in 3 months. I told him that sex can happen at their own pace when they are ready.  I also mentioned was not for or against him having sex, only that I wanted him to wait until he wouldn't get in trouble.\n\nI tried really hard to give a respectful but informative talk. My mother is pissed that I talked to him about it when she told me no.\n\nAITA for wanting my brother to be informed and safe?\n\nEdit: If it matters, I'm his sister and I am 26. I live out of state. \n\nEdit: He lives in CT since a bunch of people have asked. I mentioned in a few comments, but now it's here too.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the input and support. I'm going to have a follow up conversation with him about sexting and exchanging pictures also consent as a whole. I had missed that topic on the earlier conversation. Also big thank you for the gold! This is my first. \n\nEdit: I am overwhelmed by how much this has blown up! Gold, Silver, Platinum, and on the Front Page?! Thank you!", "My mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. It's been ok. She and I are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. She is a traditional Hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. I am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.\n\nBefore, out of consideration to my spouse and out of a belief in the my \"my house, my rules adage,\" I used to watch what I said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. But when my spouse asked if she could live with us, I said I was okay with it as long as I no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. My spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. I don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.\n\nLast week, my 10-year-old and I were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. We were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. We are very mature, I know. But when I said, \"I fart in your general direction!\" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in Spanish, \"Don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. I will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer.\" And I said, in English (I can understand Spanish but can't speak it well), \"This is my home. You don't get a say in how I interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act.\" She stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.\n\nMy spouse says ITA because I embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because I expected her to accept too much, too quickly. They also say that I am being a little culturally insensitive and that I need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how I spoke to her, so I need to apologize. But I think it was important for her to see that I will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that I won't be policed in my own home.", "I and my friends are going to be bridesmaids in our friend\u2019s wedding, and for the past few weeks we\u2019ve been searching online for bridesmaids dresses and sharing links of dresses we like in our group chat so none of us ends up buying the same or very similar dresses. My friend Ana sent a link for a green bateau dress and literally said \u201cI love this but they don\u2019t have it in my size.\u201d (She is US 14.)\n\nI agreed that the dress is beautiful while one of our other friends said that the skirt might be too wide for a bridesmaid dress. Ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group\u2019s conversation moved along. \n\nYesterday Ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. I really liked the green bateau dress so I checked if they had it in my size (I am US 8) and they did so I told our group that I was going to order the bateau dress. No one replied immediately, but I didn\u2019t think too much about it because it\u2019s not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. I ordered the dress.\n\nA few hours later I got a call from one of my friends saying that Ana called her and was upset that I ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn\u2019t buy it because it wasn\u2019t available in her size. My friend said Ana thinks I\u2019m trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that I can wear the dress she likes because I\u2019m skinnier. \n\nTo be honest I have mixed emotions about what Ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so I tried calling Ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that I didn\u2019t intend for her to feel that way. But she hasn\u2019t answered my calls or messages. \n\nSo I just want to know: AITA for thinking that there is nothing wrong with buying the dress Ana liked but couldn\u2019t buy because they didn\u2019t have it in her size in the first place, or is my friend overreacting?", "Sadly this is a serious question.\n\nIn an exclusive (not open) relationship for 8 months. BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. \n\nI saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.\n\nReddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by \"accident.\" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. \n\nAITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?\n\nEDIT: He has never cheated previously, doesn't know anyone in this country and is going there for a fairly intensive field research project. I don't believe he has an active plan to cheat. I am, however, upset, because to me the act of bringing condoms is an active refusal to close the door on the possibility of intimacy with someone else if the opportunity happens to arise.", "**Edit:** Well fuck me I just spoke with my maid. She says she hasn\u2019t seen my wife cheating but that she came home a couple of weeks ago and found my wife having a glass of wine and lying on the couch with a guy she\u2019s never seen before. From her description I\u2019ve never heard of him either. She kept it to herself as she assumed it was just a close friend of my wife. \n\nI guess this thread serves no purpose and will get locked now. So before that happens just want to thank those of you that brought this possibility to my attention. Honestly thought my marriage was perfect I never in a million years suspected my wife would be unfaithful.\n\n--- \n\nMy wife and I have 5 kids together, ranging from 2 - 15. My wife is a stay at home mom while I work a full time (8am to 7pm, 5 days a week) job. \n\nWe live in Hong Kong where it's the norm to have a maid (or \"domestic helper\" as they're called here) rather than being limited to rich. Our maid is a 34 year old Filipino woman that has been working for us since she was 19 years old. She lives with us in her own room and gets weekends off. \n\nThe problem is that my wife wants us to fire our maid. She hasn't given any specific reason other than \"I don't want a maid anymore.\" I honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but I don't want to fire her because:\n\n- She has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point\n\n- She relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it\n\n- We still have an infant/young children that require constant attention\n\n- I work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. My wife doesn't cook nor clean so I am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is gone\n\nThe woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and I don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.\n\nI'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. Jealousy does not seem to be the case here.\n\nAITA?", "A bit of backstory. I met my wife in the summer of 2008. She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?", "My friend invited my husband and me to a 40th birthday party for her husband. The party was going to be at a fairly upscale restaurant with dancing afterwards. We\u2019ve been working on some remodeling projects, so we\u2019ve been on a strict budget. My husband and I wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.\n\nWhen we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. When we were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I asked a passing waiter if I could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. The waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.\n\nMy friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but I was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.\n\nAs the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend\u2019s husband with the check. My friend\u2019s husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, \u201cI know this isn\u2019t how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. We told you that.\u201d I suddenly started panicking inside. I was trying to catch someone else\u2019s eye to see if they were panicking as much as I was. One other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. I opened the check, and the total was $211. I thought I was going to throw up. I have never spent that much on a meal.\n\nI held my shit together because I didn\u2019t want to make a scene. The couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn\u2019t paying. They said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.\n\nI ended up messaging her and said, \u201cThanks so much for inviting us to \\*\\*\\*\u2019s party. We had a great time. Just a heads up for next time, we really need to know if going to a party is going to cost more than $100. We are on a really tight budget, so a heads up would be appreciated. Thanks again.\u201d\n\nMy friend said, \u201cSorry! Should have given you a heads up. Glad you came.\u201d And we haven\u2019t spoken or hung out since. I\u2019ve tried to set up coffee dates and girl\u2019s nights but she just bails or never responds.

My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.\n\nI do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father\u2019s wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father\u2019s wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.\n\nI have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father\u2019 house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying \u201cThe blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,\u201d and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.\n\nShe then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say \u201cDon\u2019t mess with her,\u201d with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn\u2019t have to.\n\nI told her I was not going to participate\n\nShe asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.\n\nSix years\u2019 worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father\u2019s racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn\u2019t my father\u2019s child because she looks nothing like him.\n\nShe turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner. I fully admit I called her a Bitch and stated she didn\u2019t even deserve any respect from me because she didn\u2019t respect my mother\u2019s marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. After realizing what I had said, I left and haven\u2019t talked to her since.\n\nEveryone that I have talked to say I should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and I don\u2019t mind doing that.  However, certain people say I shouldn\u2019t have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.\n\nSo who is the asshole?", "Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.\n\nSo here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. \n\nI immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. \n\nWe were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.\n\n\nChris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. \n\nBoth families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. \n\nAnyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. \n\nI broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. \n\nBeing the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. \n\nEveryone in the room looked horrified. \n\nMy mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. \n\nTim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. \n\n\nThe rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...\n\n\nI am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n", "Obligatory  \"longtime lurker, first time poster\" disclaimer. Also a heads up I personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what I actually did wrong. \n\nSo last weekend I  [25M] was watching my niece [3F]. I have a daughter [5F] myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. On this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. Okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. What was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. Seriously I went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when I came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. I immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. I helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while I washed hers. \n\nI thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly I didn't even think twice about doing it. My SIL does not agree. She keeps saying that it's \"weird and creepy\" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that I should've called her to okay it first. That mindset is kinda confusing to me. Like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who I always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, what was I supposed to do? Let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? However, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when I'm a man and not her dad. Are they right and I'm missing the point or am I right that there's nothing weird about it?\n\nETA: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so I'll address them. \n\n1. My daughter's mother is dead and I'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. \n\n2. Idk if my SIL was abused. Will throw out there though that I was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and I as kids.\n\n3. I was *NOT* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think I was. I never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. \n\n4. Yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.\n\n5. Thanks whoever gave me silver.", "I had to make the hardest decision of my life a week ago and i want some AITA judgment to see if i made the right decision so please don't remove and say it needs to go tinto another subreddit cuz i'll post there too\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife went into labor a few weeks earlier then expected and she ended up giving birth at the hospital. The day it happened she told me that she was in the hospital and needed me however i had just left the house an half hour prior to go see my father who was likely about to die (he did a few hours after i arrived). I decided to see my father one last time and i felt like it was more important than seeing my child's birth because i will raise him and see him everyday for the next 18+ years and i really need to say some things to my father before he dies. My wife and the rest of her family are fucking pissed at me and said that birth is one of the most important parts of our lives and i needed to be there to support my wife and see the child. Obviously i didn't want this shit to happen but i felt seeing my father for the last time was important especially since i hadn't seen him in weeks and we weren't on good terms then which we eventually resolved thankfully. If you'd like to provide any advice you're welcome to as i could use some but I'm mainly here for judgment\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I am so surprised this post went so viral. I last saw it with like 50 comments and i then saw this on trending and I'm absolutely astonished by how viral this went. Thank you reddit for all of your support and i really appreciate you guys. Im amazed from the awards i got and up votes. Once again thank you so much for your support and this hard time. My wife and i are on good terms but I'm still getting shit from some of her family. She understands my predicament and doesn't hold it against me.", "My (24m) wife (24f) is 24 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. She made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about \"sending it back\" if it was a boy. The jokes all seemed lighthearted and I just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. Fast forward to our 20 week scan. We go in super excited and nervous. I don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. \n\nWe go in and find out we are having a boy. My wife immediately bursts into tears and I hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. She doesn't stop crying the whole day. I let her calm down and try to comfort her. \n\nIt's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. She refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. Family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. \n\nNow that it's been nearly a month I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. It's just such an overreaction. I told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. She cried and called me an asshole. I told her she needs to get a grip. I felt awful but I feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous. \n\nMy wife and I made up but she's still acting the same and I'm getting upset again. \n\nAITA for being upset about this? I love the baby beyond words and am just upset she doesn't seem to anymore.", "Using a throwaway since money is involved here. Lots of background and doing my best to keep it under 3000 words. \n\nI was born in South Africa but emigrated when I was just a few months old so I am totally American. I come from a family of full on Apartheid supporters and when it ended, basically everyone bailed for America. My parents and aunts and uncles eventually were educated and came around but my grandparents, while being very sweet and loving to me, were true believers in what apartheid stood for. They made a small fortune in South Africa by literally investing and owning businesses in the apartheid era. To be totally fair, they also made a ton of money in the US, but still the money because they were white and well connected in South Africa. \n\nMy grandmother died recently. She lived pretty lavishly up until the day she died in a very exclusive retirement home in SoCal so I figured there wouldn't be any money left and maybe I'd get some family heirlooms. My head about popped off when I saw the number me and my cousin will split (it's about $725,000 each). Money that will literally change my life. \n\nMy parents business failed so I wasn't nearly as well off as my cousin. She's also now married, lives in Rancho Santa Fe (google it if you aren't familiar) and will be just fine without this money. She claims she's going to donate 100% of it to charities in South Africa. She is seriously chiding me that *if* I plan on keeping it, then I am taking advantage of blood money built on racism. \n\nI have student loans I could pay off, I could actually have a down payment on a house, I could invest, I mean...I know where this money came from but it could literally mean my life would be better. I understand where it came from but I also can't possibly imagine giving it away. I have no idea what charities are like in South Africa and family friends we have that still live there say that corruption has taken over everything from government to charities and I'm better off just keeping it. \n\nI understand my cousins point but man is it hard to say goodbye to that much money that will change my life.", "On a road trip last week, my girlfriend and I stopped at a rural diner for brunch. We sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). It was a very nice meal honestly. Our total was around $25. I was ready to pay with my debit card.\n\nThe waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. Unfortunately I had zero cash on me. \"How were we supposed to know?\" I asked. She shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. Because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. There was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.\n\nShe sighs and points to an ATM on the other side of the dining room. At this point I'm still apologetic so I went there with my card. I noticed it had a fee of, I shit you not, $9. I asked to speak to the manager. She brought the owner.\n\nI told the owner this is ridiculous. I suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that ATM. Nope. He threatened to call the police. I said go ahead. My girlfriend felt the same way. Long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.\n\nI told my sister about this today. She thinks the cops were wrong and I was being an asshole. Because \"you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars.\" I think the owner is the asshole. The only part I regret was not being able to tip the waitress.\n\nAITA?", "Yeah, I'm probably a major asshole here, but let me explain my reasoning.\n\nI came into her life 6 years ago when she was 11. Her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). Her mother is not happy. She hasn't been happy for a long time. Her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids I've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.\n\nShe's made it no secret she hates me. I remember when she was 13 or 14, I paid for us to go to Disney land as a family vacation (cliche, I know). She refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. I was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, I went along with it and stayed home.\n\nStuff like that is the norm. She'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. She'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. It's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. But it's ruined the marriage, because I've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. Anything I do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. Though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.\n\nAnyway, my wife and I separated over this. It's just too much for me to bare. But I'm not mad at my wife, I'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.\n\nI decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. I didn't do this to spite her, because frankly I'm ready to move on with my life. I did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. I did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)\n\nWife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. Say it's going to emotionally scar her. But quite frankly, I think she needed to be told.\n\nAITA?", "I was at chipotle for lunch today and I was sitting at a 2 person table by myself. I finished eating and went to get a refill, and 2 girls were sitting at my table. I told them that I was still sitting there since I still had 20 mins of lunch left. They pretty much ignored me and said \u201cthere\u2019s no more open seats\u201d. So I said fuck it and started to walk away when they said \u201care you gonna throw away your trash?\u201d which I replied \u201cit\u2019s not my table\u201d and left. AITA?", "I\u2019m 19F and my date was 25M, I was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while I was half way through my session. \n\nI get an IG message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would\u2019ve found me since my page is super private, my username isn\u2019t specific at all to my real name and I have 40 followers. \nHe explains he\u2019s so and so\u2019s friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it\u2019s hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so I\u2019m excited and we plan to meet up. \n\nWe catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, I take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. I smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. We\u2019re in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.\n\nI study justice so he\u2019s telling me how he\u2019s an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that\u2019s when I freak. he makes a comment about how high I am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point I start to get really scared.\nHe keeps asking if anyone knows I\u2019m with him, who I live with, how much money I make & how much I have on me etc. Just weird questions. I was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction IMO was much more extreme. I was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. My perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say I was genuinely scared.\n\nI hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so I could be around people and also so he wasn\u2019t DUI, he didn\u2019t want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that I felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.\n\nI get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he\u2019s taking a phone call. I go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene \u201cI\u2019m really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me\u201d they catch on and can see I\u2019m upset. I sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he\u2019ll take me home but they are very firm. He addresses me quite angrily and asks \u201cwho does your mum think your with?\u201d The owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. \n\nI felt guilty since I had gotten along with him and he\u2019d taken the time to see me, I\u2019m not 100% sure if I was in danger and if I could\u2019ve stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. I tried to have tact in the situation and didn\u2019t have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would\u2019ve been better to tell him I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.\n\nEdit: Some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, I\u2019m super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong please. I genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there\u2019s something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way I did and if I\u2019m the AHole for handling a bad date this way. I see that this isn\u2019t as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here IRL I had very mixed and negative reactions. Hence why I got on here and despite all that, I do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying I did the right thing even though it didn\u2019t necessarily feel like that in the moment.", "I met my wife in my early 30s. She was in her mid 20s at the time. I was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. She on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. \n\nSo when I meet her we click instantly and I fall head over heels for her. We get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. When we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. Obviously I was jealous but I went along with it since it seemed logical.\n\nSo she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while I work 12 hour days and then some. I\u2019m not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.\n\nA couple years ago I discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend\u2019s husband. Divorced obviously followed.\n\nThe only major asset we had in the US was our house, which was a premarital asset. We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. \n\nNow if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I\u2019d have no problem paying what\u2019s fair. But the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. \n\nSo in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.\n\nSo here I am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. So I sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it\u2019s taking so long to liquidate our savings. Once abroad I immediately stop alimony payments.\n\nNow she has no legal recourse (I\u2019ve double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m asking here is that my own children are split on this. My son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. I figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.", "My son died at age 4. On the first mothers day after he died my husband got me a necklace with some of his ashes in. I wear it every single day.\n\nMy Aunt is not someone I see often. She got on with my son but only really saw him a handful of times a year. She came a few times to see him when he was sick but not often. When we were told he didn't have long left I asked if she wanted to come and say goodbye and she said she was too busy with work. I figured she was in denial, maybe. I certainly was. She then missed his funeral to go to a concert.\n\nHer husband messaged me yesterday asking if he would be able to get some of our sons ashes so she can have some jewellery made. Apparently she asked him for one for her birthday as she really misses our son and wants to feel close to him. I said no because I want him to stay with us. All of him. Then my Aunt called me yesterday afternoon and said I was being selfish, he was her family too. \n\nI still said no. She said she acted the way she did when he died because she was struggling with it, and was in denial. But so was I. But it's been 3 years and she's hardly come to see any of us. She's not even met our newest baby yet who is 4 months old. \n\nSo tell me, as my Aunt seems to think I am, am I being the asshole?", "**UPDATE:** \n\nI was not expecting to post an update so soon, but I was hit with a bombshell this afternoon.\n\nOver the weekend, both of our parents had tried to come talk to me. However I had simply ignored the knocks on the door and eventually they left. However of course they know that I can't avoid work. So they wait outside my house this afternoon to ambush me as I get home from work. With them is my girlfriend. They insist I talk to my girlfriend and I eventually relent and our parents leave.\n\nOnce inside, she starts apologising and begging for forgiveness. Saying that our relationship is the best thing that ever happened to her, she will never forgive herself.... Basically everything that you'd expect a cheater to say.\n\n...And then she gives the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. She says that a few weeks ago she found out she was pregnant, she started having conflicted feelings on if she was ready to settle down and start a family, and so she reached out to her ex for support. This emotional support quickly turned physical\n\nThis makes NO sense. We have ALWAYS talked about having kids excitedly.\n\nShe takes out two pregnancy tests showing positive results. She also takes out an unused one and says she can take it now if I don't believe her. So she takes it, and sure enough she's pregnant. She says it's 100% mine as she didn't cheat on me until after she got pregnant. I ask to see her phone. She reluctantly hands it over and, sure enough, she's been texting him non-stop since I threw her out.\n\nI tell her I need time to process this and ask her to wait outside. Once outside I lock the doors, unblock her on WhatsApp, and send her a long text. I'm reciting this by memory so I don't have to open WhatsApp and see her reply.\n\n>Whether you end up having this baby is entirely up to you. But you should know the following. First, if the child is mine, I will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. We will never get back together. The moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. Secondly, I will not interact with you at all until the child is born. Don't reach out to me until then, I want nothing to do with you. Finally, I will not have ANY role in the kid's life - nor will I sign any birth certificate - until I get a paternity test. This child could have been the greatest blessing to our relationship and future, instead you turned them into an excuse to cheat. I will never forgive you for that.\n\nI have not read her reply, and don't intend to tonight. I also won't post any updates after this. I get the impression that the kid is probably mine, so I'm basically anchoured to her for the rest of my life now.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**Original Post**\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**With regards to the meta post:** I know I'm not an asshole for leaving her. I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day (**edit: with landlord's permission**) while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\n**Edit2: The lease is also only in my name and she's never paid a dime of rent in the entire time she's been living here.**", "So this month I was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which I had booked and seats selected for. I specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat \u2014 just the aisle and window. \n\nWell, a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats.

I\u2019m mentally crossing my fingers he\u2019s not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. \n\nI get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. After a minute, I decided to be upfront and tell him:\n\n\u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry but this situation is not working for me, you\u2019re taking up quite a bit of my seat\u201d. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there\u2019s not nothing he can do \u2014 although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. It just wasn\u2019t enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I\u2019m talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. \n\nI end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. She instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren\u2019t any open seats on this flight, so there wasn\u2019t a way to move people so he could have two. This causes a very awkward silence. \n\nThe guy seemed embarrassed and didn\u2019t want to get up. He mentioned how he can\u2019t wait for a later flight. I felt bad for him but I was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight \u2014 the comfort I paid for. The flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he\u2019ll need to book another flight. The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here\u2019s where I made my offer. \n\nI told the guy, \u201cLook, I\u2019ll put up with this if you give me $150 \u2014 that\u2019s half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.\u201d\n\nHe instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. He even told me he appreciated it. \n\nWell the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn\u2019t volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. I just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. \n\nFrom my perspective, I gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and I was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person\u2019s body pressed against you involuntarily). A win-win. He wasn\u2019t angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. \n\nAfter the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but I ignored them. This leads me to beg the question, AITA? ", "Yeah, I know this sounds awful.\n\nMy (32M) wife's (35F) daughter (16F) recently announced she is pregnant. \n\nShe claims she doesn't know who the father is. I suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. I mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? It can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake.\n\nAnyway, moving on. She is adamant on keeping the baby. Abortion is out of the question apparently. Wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. They're both ecstatic.\n\nThe problem I have with this is:\n\n1. My wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. She's still in school and fully intends to go to college. My wife and I will 100% end up looking after it.\n\n2. I am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. My wife works part time and makes very little money. I don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me.\n\n3. I wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. She's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. I feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us.\n\nI raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. \"This isn't up to you. This is her decision to make. We will support her.\"\n\nI agree it's her decision, but why do I have to support her?\n\nAs it stands now, I'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. I'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am I prepared to pay to raise it.\n\nI fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it.\n\nAITA?", "This happened a couple of days ago and I was really pissed. I'm here because I want to know if I'm in the wrong here. \n\nMy wife is going to give birth to our twin daughters. I've done everything to support her. I make breakfast everyday and I make it a point to make whatever she asks me to make. \n\nYesterday, my wife woke me up at 2am and told me that she wanted to eat icecream. We had no ice cream left because she ate it all at night. I really wanted to get her the ice cream. She told me that she wanted choco chip. I drove for an hour to find a place at that time. But they didn't have any choco chip at that time. I didn't want to disappoint her, so I got strawberry, her next favourite flavour. \n\nWhen I got back, I told her that I didn't find choco chip. Idk what happened but she started crying and yelling  at me. She threw away the ice cream, called me a fucking imbecile and told me I didn't love her. She also told me that she didn't want to sleep next to me. I slept in another room. \n\nNow today, she comes to me, cries, apologizes and tells me that she was really stressed out. But I did not sleep with her at night. I've decided that I don't want to do anything now. This is not the first time this has happened. I'm not a fantastic cook. She insists that I make something for her, but when I make it she always tells me that it's horrible. She later apologizes and tells me that it was wonderful ( all this started after the pregnancy ). WIBTA here??", "Bit long, stick with me. Throwaway because I'm active on a mom board, and haven't discussed this there.\n\nMy ex and I split 5 years ago now. We had a daughter who is 16, a son who is 13 and a daughter who is 5. He's always been a good dad, and we split 50/50 custody, essentially the kids one week my house/one week his house. After my divorce, I reconnected with a high school boyfriend and fell head over heels in love again. He's in the military but hadn't had to move in years. We married 2 years ago. \n\nA year ago, he got orders to move to Texas from where we all were in California. My older two kids were not happy at all, and didn't want to move, while the baby didn't really express a preference. I approached my ex and told him the situation. I said I know the situation sucks, but we'd foot the bill to him for every trip to him on holidays, breaks, summers, etc. He blew his top and said absolutely not, I wouldn't \"take his kids away\" and said he'd see me in court.\n\nThe judge ended up ruling in his favor, and I was awarded summers and every other holiday. I was absolutely devastated. I moved, and I've barely seen the kids since. They came at Christmas for a week, and it was tense the whole time. The older kids, especially my daughter, are short with me on FaceTime, while the baby gets distracted and can't chat much. My daughter has said I chose a man over her, and that she wants nothing to do with me, while my son won't talk about it but I can tell he's angry. \n\nI've asked my ex to talk to them about it and he basically said I chose to leave, it's my fault and he's not getting involved in \"our issues\". So, let me have it Reddit, AITA?", " I know the title itself makes me sound awful but hear me out. I've been with my boyfriend for 7 months and he's small down there, like 4 inches give or take. He constantly asks me if it's big enough, if I can feel it, and I always reassure him and tell him he's fine. I tell him I'm not with him for his penis and he has nothing to worry about.\n\n However the last few days he got increasingly agitated and kept asking me if I was lying, if he's too small, and wouldn't take \"You're fine\" or \"You're average\" or \"I don't care how big it is\" for an answer. I told him to stop pestering me but this went on for a few more days until I snapped and told him he's below average but he has nothing to worry about. Obviously he didn't take it well.\n\n I don't lie to him and say it's big, I say he's average, has nothing to worry about, etc. ", "My wife and I have a 6 month old baby girl and a two year old boy. Wife hasn\u2019t been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and I actually just got a new job. \n\nAt my old job I was working 45-50 hours a week. At my new job my hours fluctuate a lot \u2014 it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. I make a lot more though so there\u2019s that. The pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. My wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a SAHM which is what she\u2019s wanted. \n\nThe issue is that my wife and I aren\u2019t on the same page about what this change would mean. Before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. We also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (Plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). \n\nI told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. These cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and I also think it\u2019s practical.  She was mostly agreeable to that. But then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. \n\nI told her there was no way I was going to be taking on as many work hours as I am and then come home to cook or clean too. That would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. \n\nShe looked at me like I was some sort of Neanderthal but I think what I\u2019m saying is completely fair. I\u2019m not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. Just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. I recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce I would support her 100%. But I think it\u2019s fair that if I\u2019m the sole paycheck and working crazy hours I don\u2019t come home to more stress and chaos. \n\nObviously my wife and I will have to work this out between ourselves. I\u2019m mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base. \n\n**Edit: Well this blew up since I last checked it. I can see people are really passionate about this topic and you all have encouraged me to think more deeply about it. I will read as many of the (4.2K??) comments as I can. I think I\u2019ll let my wife take a look at the thread too since many have gone out of their way to offer constructive comments for both of us.**", "I am a college student who wears hearing aids, which help a lot but I do still have diminished hearing. I struggle hearing in loud background noise or while talking to a person with an accent. When choosing classes, I pick professors with English names over foreign ones. Last week, while registering for classes next semester, I mentioned this to my friend (who, FWIW, is a native English speaking white person) and he called me a racist asshole and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. AITA?", "My sister is 34 and I'm 40, but since our early 20s people have always assumed she's the older sister. \n\nI don't know why she seems to have aged early or why I look younger - I was an alcoholic and a drug user in my 20s and probably deserve to look older. I used to joke that it was payback for her being prettier (she was and still is a total babe).\n\nI moved away years ago and we only see each other occassionally. Last weekend I went back to our hometown for the wedding of a family friend we hadn't seen in ages, and I was shocked by her appearance.\n\nI knew she used botox, but this was next level. Her face was puffy, her lips were super-plump, her eyes looked different and there was not a wrinkle to be seen. I asked about it straight away and she admitted she'd had her eyelids lifted and \"quite a bit of filler\". I'm cool with that - do what makes you happy.\n\nShe asked me not to tell anyone and I said of course I wouldn't. But then...\n\nNow, I thought she looked weird because I know what she normally looks like without filters and facetune, but people from our childhood who hadn't seen us in years didn't and were saying how young she looked and asking what her secret was.\n\nI was absolutely fine with that until she said:\n\n\"It's probably because I didn't drink and smoke my way through my 20s like ambiguousturtlejuice.\"\n\nAs a recovering alcoholic who prefers people to not know, I was hurt by that. Without thinking I blurted out (louder than I'd intended): \"Oh fuck off - it's all the plastic surgery and botox and fillers\".\n\nI regretted it before I'd even finished saying it, but I thought she'd laugh it off and it would be fine... but she got teary and flustered and ran out of the room.\n\nMy mom thinks she was an asshole for bringing up my drinking. My brother thinks she over-reacted and should get over it. Pretty much everyone else thinks I am a massive asshole.\n\nSo, AITA?", "Several days ago we invited a friend and his girlfriend over for dinner. Before we start, some background about my friend: I've known him for almost 15 years, he never had a lot of money, but he never let that get in the way. He worked hard, saved hard, and bought things if he decided he really wanted them, but was not a spendthrift. He paid his way through university without taking any loans, working his ass off in two jobs while full time studying. He recently opened a startup of his own which has great potential and has started getting nibbles and several customers, but is far from being a success, or even profitable, yet.\n\nOn to the story - they were talking about how they were looking to buy a car (his first), because now that they lived together, she felt that they could split the cost of a car because they were saving money on rent. I could tell my friend wasn't too hot on the expense, because all his money was in the startup and he'd need to take out a loan to get a car, in addition to the loans he had already taken out to get his business up and running. When we were talking about it, his girlfriend kept saying things about how \"At 33 years old I shouldn't have to take the bus anymore\", and \"Taking public transportation is for losers\". As someone who bought my first car (used) at 31 because my family was growing, I'll admit I took some offense to that. I've used public transportation for years (and still do) and never considered it \"beneath me\".\n\nThe real kicker came when she started talking about getting a brand-new car, straight from the dealership. Wouldn't even consider getting something a coupla years old. Here's where I may have overstepped my bounds, and told her that her entire attitude is spoiled, and that if she really cared about my friend, she'd realize that he doesn't have the ability to spend that much money, and she should look at something cheaper if she wouldn't deign to ride the bus with the rest of the common folk. \n\nAfter a minute or so of awkwardness, the conversation switched to other topics and the subject of the car was dropped. After they left, my wife said I shouldn't have called her spoiled to her face and I almost ruined dinner for everyone. My friend told me, though, that she dropped the idea of the brand new car and they're looking at the user car lots.\n\nSo, AITA?", "I'm black. My husband is white. He has a sister, who has a 3-year-old daughter who LOVES me, and who I think isn't too bad herself. My niece is equal parts terror and lovely, but mostly with me lovely. We hang out a lot to give my SIL a break, and my husband doesn't really \"get kids\" so it's often 1x1. \n\nI was out with my niece at a kid's playplace/mall for kids, and she was more terror than lovely. She was defiant, and I'm all about consequences after two warnings. She kept running from me laughing her butt off, so I told her it was time to go. Normally she'll go quietly but this time, filled with vim, vigor and grape juice, she pitched a GIGANTIC fit so I had to carry her. She wasn't screaming in a \"WHO IS THIS HELP ME\" way but in a clearly understandable \"NO, I WANT TO STAY AND PLAY. AUNTIE(ME), NO\" way. But also she's 3, so maybe if you're not used to her it's not clear. \n\nAs we're leaving, a lady stops us asking if everything's okay. I smiled at her, and told her yes, that we just had to get home for a nap. She then got in my face like \"Do you KNOW this child.\" I'm wrangling a screaming toddler, so I just said yes and tried to step around her. She then said, \"you're not leaving until you prove you know that child.\" I told her, it's fine, we're related (my niece now was calm and holding me), she's just acting b-r-a-t-t-y and she said like, \"No mother would EVER say that about her kid\". Yeah, maybe. But she can't spell so. She then demanded I give her my niece, or call someone to confirm my identity. \n\nI was pissed. I told her I don't have to prove anything to her and I'm leaving with my kid. She then literally RAN  to security, screaming that a kid's being kidnapped. Cops called. Security guy asks what's up. I was polite to him but I told the lady off. I said it's way too damn *present day* to be act like  mixed race children, or blended family don't exist, and to IMMEDIATELY jump to kidnapping was insane. The cops showed, and they asked my niece who I am \"AUNTIE (ME)!\" and I showed them some pictures of us together in clearly different settings, they apologized, reprimanded her. It's done. \n\nShe  works somewhere in the complex, but not where we were. I want to report it. She'd been watching us and saw my niece and I hanging for at LEAST 30 minutes familiarly. So while I could have showed her the pictures, I didn't feel like I needed to. It's not her job and in fact the person whose job it was apologized to me as we left. Now, I have had this happen before, and someone is a little sketched. I'm polite, it becomes obvious that she knows me, and they drop it. I just had flashforwards to a time when my niece might pull the \"THIS ISN'T MY MOM\" card. And then I really WOULD need the cops to be called because I'd kill her. \n\nI get she was concerned. And that unlikely I'd adopted a white baby. But also, 100% fuck off, lady. AITA? Would I be if I complained to the facility?", "This is very fresh, posting from my phone and a throwaway because I\u2019m honestly nervous about how big this is going to get. I just got an email from the assistant superintendent of the entire district that I have to be in his office Monday morning and I\u2019m scared shitless. \n\nBasically I just graduated college and got my teaching certificate last year. The school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so I volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this. We have some very talented girls and I enjoy it. \n\nWe were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. On Monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. They argued it was for thier comfort since it\u2019s about 80 here today. I was a little nervous but agreed. Apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. I\u2019m so naive I thought initially people were just being charitable but when I saw boys from surrounding schools I knew somthing was up. And it wasn\u2019t long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. The girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made. \n\nParents are furious with me and obviously it\u2019s gone up the chain. I\u2019m hoping to god I can chalk this up to my inexperience and I\u2019m not fired buf when I had a 6\u20194\u201d dad screaming in my face that he\u2019s going to get my fired...I\u2019m scared. \n\nAm I the asshole for allowing this?\n\nEdit: Just as a quick update, in rhe last few minutes I've gotten two texts from parents offering me thier support and willing to show up with me Monday to at the very least talk about how out of line the dad was who screamed in my face, that makes me feel a little better.", "I made an ALT account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.\nI\u2019m also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so I\u2019ll try to keep it as PG as I can.\n\nSo, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b-bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\nEDIT:\nHere\u2019s an update, for people who wanted it. Ignore if you don\u2019t care, I won\u2019t be mad: https://www.reddit.com/user/waywiser86/comments/azskqk/aita_only_update/", "Last fall, my husband and I went to my cousin's wedding in another state. \n\nIn the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. She was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. The wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. I thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. She didn't tell the couple tho. Just complained about it to us behind their backs. \n\nWe traveled 600 miles to the wedding. We treated the trip like a vacation. Spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. \n\nThe day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. Not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. I hate dressing up so I was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. \n\nMy husband and I had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. A few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. I wore a hoodie, daisy Duke shorts and cute sandals. \n\nI noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but I figured they didn't get the memo. The bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which I thought was weird for a casual wedding. The reception was awesome. Nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. We had a blast. \n\nSo we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. They thought it was very disrespectful. Apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. This explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. \n\nTBH we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. And they never specified the dress code in the invitation. But I still have to ask. AITA?", "Okay this is so stupid and I really feel like I'm NTA but my friend is adamant that I am so I'm seeking Reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. \n\nMy girl friends and I were recently at Canada's Wonderland and having been there dozens of times since I was a kid (am now in my 20s), I know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has \"additional stalls\" at the back of the bathroom. \n\nSo basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says \"additional stalls ->\" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. \n\nWell, for the last few times I've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and I always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. There never is and I use the bathroom stalls there. On my way out I'll always tell other women\"hey there's stalls back there\" to which they say thank you.\n\nMy friend now thinks I'm selfish and rude for doing this. She thinks that I should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. \n\nI don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. Not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. \n\nMy friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she \"sees a different side\" of me. This is something I truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, I'm starting to question if she's right?\n\nPlease tell me if I'm wrong, seriously, I don't get it. \n\nTL;DR: Apparently I'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.\n\nEDIT: This is epic.. I really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. Thank you to everyone that replied. I'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.\n\nAnd to all women, I'm sorry our bathrooms suck. I'll be even more helpful letting others know about those stalls in the future.. having to pee really bad and waiting is the worst. Tiny bladder club!!", "Hi everyone, I\u2019d like some input. \n\nMy wife and I struggle to make ends meet. We strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. This includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. \n\nRecently our DD dropped the milk and spilled it. It was 5 days to payday and we\u2019d already done our grocery shopping. My wife said she\u2019d figure it out. I know she has a little money stashed for herself that she\u2019s gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, I figured she must have decided to dip into that. Boy was I wrong. \n\nThe next week I noticed our food was a little...higher quality. A couple of brand name things, even a roast on Sunday with asparagus. I figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when I asked she said \u201coh no, I found a bunch of money off coupons.\u201d Then she showed a few to me. \n\nThey were those \u201cEarn 0.07$ a gallon\u201d receipts you get at the gas station. She had gone there and dug through the garbage! She said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. \n\nI was speechless. I asked her how she could lower herself like that. She replied that she did it for our kids. When I asked why she didn\u2019t use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. \n\nI\u2019m so disgusted guys. I can\u2019t believe she did this. I don\u2019t even want to look at her. She on the other hand is mad at me, and says I\u2019m an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. AITA for expecting my wife NOT to dumpster dive?\n\nEdit: OK! I am definitely the asshole. After reading all of your comments, I really thought about it. I talked to my wife, and told her I was sorry for the way I acted. She is annoyed but willing to forgive me. I was actually mad at myself. The reason we are struggling is because I was in an accident a few months ago. I slid through a stop light on an icy road. It has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade I\u2019ve worked in for 15 years. I\u2019m on disability through my employer but it isn\u2019t even half of what I used to make. We are getting by, but it is tight. And I don\u2019t know what we are going to do when it runs out. My wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). I guess I was just mad at myself because I can\u2019t take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. I\u2019m going to give her a foot rub tonight. Thanks for the honesty guys. ", "So, I've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. But basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.\n\nI've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.\n\nWell, it didn't stop. \n\nAnyway, since I'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, I've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until I kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.\n\nThe noises are kind of, like, SKREEEEEEEOOOOOOOASH! SKREEEEASCCHHHHH! followed by snorts and the like.\n\nSo far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what I'm doing downstairs. I brush it off like it's no big deal and I really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. His audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor Gargoyle rears its ugly head.\n\nAITA for making gargoyle noises to ruin my roommate's mood with his gf because he won't respect my wishes to not have audibly loud sex in the middle of the night on weekdays?\n\n*inserted a clip that approximates the noise: https://youtu.be/8ij3L4mpUzw?t=8", "Basically I'm 25m and she's 23F.\n\nShe gets company credit for food and drinks as she works for like a week at a time. She cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. She always goes to the same coffee shop. \n\nMe and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. She always says the guy who serves her coffee is \"beautiful\", she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. That was fine. \n\nAnyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. I trust her ENTIRELY, I know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything. \n\nAnyway, I went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. I ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and I shit you not he said \"oh is that for Emma?\" And when I looked shocked he went \"I just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it\". I said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. The guy kinda laughed and i said that I appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, I think he was flirting. He laughed again and said sure thing. \n\n\nI didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare I embarrass her like that. This pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! She said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend. \nFair, innocent mistake on my behalf but the gf never told me this beautiful man was gay. \n\nShe stormed out and still won't speak to me without making sly digs. \n\nAITA? \n\n**Tl;Dr** told the barista that my gf wasn't single and was with me as I thought they were flirting.", "My 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a Nintendo Switch so he can play BOTW. Right now he has $200 saved up. At his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.\n\nI know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn\u2019t been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. Now I have to say, he\u2019s a really good kid. Kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. He\u2019s been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.\n\nInstead of making him do more chores to earn more money, I thought of a more fun solution to help him get his Switch. I told him, if you can beat Ocarina of Time (without Googling for help - though I would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old N64, I\u2019ll pay for the rest of your Switch and get you BOTW. Wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. Part of my reasoning too is I just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and OoT is a timeless classic. \n\nHe jumped at the idea! After a weekend of playing, he\u2019s already at Zoras domain as young link. He seems to be having fun with it and hasn\u2019t gotten too frustrated yet. He\u2019s only played Minecraft really so the dated graphics don\u2019t bother him either. \n\nBut anyway I told a couple friends about it, and they think I\u2019m a massive dick. That I\u2019m trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that I should just get him the Switch because he\u2019s already such a good kid. Now I\u2019m having second thoughts and am feeling bad about it, but he does seem to be enjoying the challenge. \n\nSo AITA?", "My husband and I have a 15 year old son, who is biracial; my husband is African American and I am white (this will be important later on in the story). My son just got his driver\u2019s permit and has begun driving with me on a regular basis. The other day we were on the road, and he accidentally cut off a truck, making him have to break abruptly.\n\nI scolded my son and gave a \u201csorry\u201d wave to the driver. At the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. His car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. He rolled down the window and shouted the N-word at my son. My son\u2019s face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. The encounter **sickened** me.\n\nI did some research on the company; at one point I even plugged them into Facebook. They have a very active Facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. I called the company and reported the man\u2019s behavior, describing him very vividly. They informed me that they knew exactly who I was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. I had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.\n\nTwo months later, when I was browsing Facebook kind of boredly one day, the company\u2019s name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it I clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. One of the very first photos/posts I saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. To my horror, I saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. Meaning they didn\u2019t fire him.\n\nThe company is part of a nationwide chain, so I called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person I could get to, and I reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn\u2019t fire him. The man I spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person I\u2019d reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. Additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have \u201cno place\u201d and \u201cno future\u201d in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee\u2019s career is now toast.\n\nWas it right of me to \u201cdouble-report\u201d this guy? I\u2019m sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that I was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. Am I an asshole or a \u201cKaren\u201d for not dropping this matter?", "tl;dr at bottom\n\nOkay so I\u2019m almost 19.\n\nWhen my paternal uncle was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. They got married later on, converted to Christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. \n\nI know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. He didn\u2019t say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. I thought it\u2019s weird they never told their daughters, given that they\u2019re all such protestors against abortion.\n\nBut anyways dad also has a sister, who\u2019s daughter I\u2019m really close with. She\u2019s Christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last May. Then her boyfriend left her over it. I absolutely adore her baby, and I try to help raise him given that he doesn\u2019t have a father.\n\nI\u2019m usually on good terms with my aforementioned uncle\u2019s daughters, and I was messaging them three way last night. I was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and eventually they asked why I would celebrate him so much given that he was created in sin.\n\nI told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone makes mistakes. But they overrode me, saying that she\u2019s easy and shouldn\u2019t have spread her legs blah blah blah. It went on for a few more messages.\n\nI got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said \n\n\u201cYeah I hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion all outside of marriage way back when. Everyone makes mistakes and our cousin is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.\u201d\n\nThree hours later and there was still no response; I knew I was in deep shit.\n\nAnd I was! My parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night, meaning I\u2019m using my old old old phone right now. They were very tense with me today. I was very earnest. \n\nI always like posting online where no one can physically judge me, so thus I ask, AITA for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?\n\ntl;dr: uncle and aunt got abortion way back when, told unbeknownst cousins about it when they judged our cousin for having baby out of wedlock, parents mad at me. AITA?", "I got pregnant in high school, when I was 17 (I am just turning 30 now). I wanted an abortion and my boyfriend begged, begged, begged, guilted, begged me to carry the fetus to term and that he would raise the baby himself. He involved his parents, who involved my parents, and since my parents were against abortion, they agreed on my behalf that this is what would happen.\n\nI was naive at the time about how horrible pregnancy and delivery would be with a baby you don't want. I was miserable, in pain, anxious, isolated, and sick the whole time. Delivery was a nightmare. The whole process was so traumatic that I've been diagnosed with PTSD from it, for which I've been in therapy for the last four years.\n\nIn my country, if both parents are 18 and both agree to it, one parent can legally give up parental obligations, so I did that. I haven't regretted it for a minute (I do regret not getting an abortion because of the trauma it caused me, I do NOT regret giving up parental rights). I do not think about this child, I do not think of myself as having a child, I am not a mother. I have never met the child and never want to.\n\nLast month, my exboyfriend contacted me (again through my parents) because he and his wife have split up and now that his daughter is 12, she wants to know about the circumstances of her birth. I told him that we did things according to his wishes and I never, ever want contact with his child and don't want him to tell her my name or contact information.\n\nHe and my parents are furious and my parents also admitted they thought I'd 'come around.' They want to be in his child's life but want me to also be a part of it. I won't. Am I the asshole here? All I have done is what I have always said I would do.\n\nNote: Sorry, English isn't my first language. I also tried to talk this out on another forum and it turned into a very US-centric conversation about abortion and child support but none of that applies as I am not from US and we do not have the same type of child support laws.", "Background: I have this friend Mandy who I guess what you'd call \"militantly obese.\" She has claimed in the past that it's a civil rights issue and that she is \"genetically fat\" just like people are \"genetically black\" (her words, not mind but you can see her mindset). \n\nRecently Mandy's husband said enough is enough is enough and told her that if she didn't at least make and effort to change he was leaving. Mandy was diagnosed with being pre-diabetic and called me sobbing both because of what her husband said and the doctor being \"anofher link in the chain.\" \n\nThis was about January and Mandy and her husband have been on a calorie restricted diet and he has lost...probably 20lbs and Mandy has actually gained weight. Mandy was using this as \"proof\" that her issue was genetic. \n\nI was helping Mandy unload groceries the other day and came across a huge Tupperware bin the back of her suv. I assumed she wanted it unloaded but as I moved it, the lid came loose and it was packed to the gills with treats, most opened and half eaten. I asked her about it. She got super defensive and told me to mind my own business. I asked her if this why she's gaining weight. She told me to fuck off. I texted her husband because in the heat of the moment I was furious she had spoken to me like that.\n\nHer husband has filed for emergency seperatrion so Mandy can't ruin him financially (she has threatened this in the past) with the aim of divorce. Mandy is blaming me, am I the asshole here?\n\n\nEdit: I accept my judgment and I won't delete but the comments have taken a ridiculous turn and I don't want to he part of this anymore. No I don't want to have sex with him. Nor did I ever imply or infer that. Enjoy your day.\n\n\nEdit 2: based on some responses that said I was the asshole for acting out of anger rather than concern (which I accept) I called and told Mandy that I was sorry for my reasons for texting her husband. She said that I am just another person oppressing her and that even the Avengers were oppressing her these days. I asked her what she meant (won\u2019t spoil the movie) but I explained to her that I was acting out of frustration and Avengers is just a movie and now I was really concerned. She said I could take my concern and shove it up my ass and we\u2019re done and hung up and has apparently blocked my number. Thank you for participating but I think it\u2019s a dead subject at this point. I hope she gets the help she needs", "8 years ago I got a gorgeous chug. While extremely high I decided that the greatest dog name ever thought of is Askim, because when people ask me his name and I tell them about 50% of the time they\u2019ll awkwardly bend down and ask my dog it\u2019s name. It\u2019s hilarious. \nI had my fun for the first few weeks but eventually everyone had just gotten used to the name and the joke faded away. Occasionally I\u2019ll be chatting to someone that hasn\u2019t met Askim yet and when they ask his name I have my little laugh but other than that it\u2019s a dead joke. \nWell, I just moved into a new neighborhood with a great park that has lots of dogs and very chatty regulars. An elderly lady asked Askim\u2019s name, said \u201cwhat?\u201d So I repeated myself and she turned to my dog and asked him his name. I quickly explained but instead of getting the usual chuckle she became extremely upset and felt very humiliated. Since then a couple of people at the park have approached me and told me they \u201cheard about my joke\u201d and that they didn\u2019t appreciate pranks in a nice family park.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t get it, but since the people that have reacted well to my dog\u2019s dumb name have been friends, coworkers and family and these strangers are having a very different reaction I\u2019ll accept your judgement on it.\n\nEDIT: it\u2019s a always a little jarring to wake up to 650+ notifications, I\u2019ll go through them at my own pace throughout the day.\n\nI should have been clearer, but I guess I didn\u2019t know how to spell it out until I saw you guys suggest it. I absolutely think that the reason for her reaction is that I made her feel foolish, and she undoubtedly thought I did that intentionally. This is a pretty close knit community and she sought support from her friends who just took her distress at face value and confronted me about it.\n\nThe truth is that I say the word \u201cAskim\u201d multiple times a day. I\u2019m aware that the name originated in a joke but at this point it\u2019s just a thing I call my dog. When going out I\u2019m not looking for new victims or inviting people to get tricked, and I wasn\u2019t trying to trick her, It was small talk and I didn\u2019t even  think about it until I got a negative reaction. \n\nIt\u2019s been pointed out that elderly people can feel really insecure about their diminishing faculties and I know from personal experience that it\u2019s very true. I really like the idea of posting an explanation on the community Facebook page, especially now that I know it\u2019s Turkish meaning and that it\u2019s a town in Norway and neighborhood in Sweden.", "My daughter passed away 6 years ago fighting a rare genetic condition. The condition was also responsible for my late wife's death when my daughter was only an infant. I don't want to discuss anything related to that now. Let me talk about the issue at hand. \n\nI'm now married to my amazing wife. I have a stepdaughter who will be starting high school shortly. I made a lot of investments for my late daughter. I thought I could give her a head start in life. But that never happened. So I decided to donate the money to a charity ( which helps kids with  genetic disorders ). The investments I made mature in an year and I plan on donating all of it. \n\nNow my wife wants me to use the money for my stepdaughter. She tells me that this will help her have a head start in life and that would partially fulfill the purpose of the investments. She thinks this will also help us finance her college education. She doesn't want her getting bogged down by loans, which is a sound argument. I love my stepdaughter, but I don't think I'm ready to do this. I want to donate the money. WIBTA here?", "I (27F) and my roommate (23M) rent from our landlord (60M) and are both on the lease. Recently my roommate started dating a woman (19F) with a kid (toddler). \n\nBoth the woman and the kid are really annoying. I'm childfree and dislike being around children. This annoying toddler always screams and throws tantrums. I could deal with this until now. Roommate's girlfriend decided it was ok for her to move in without paying rent since she got kicked out of her parents house (wonder why?). I am very vocally not happy with this and I told the landlord immediately and he said he'd do something about it but never did. It's been a month so I'm not even sure if she can be legally evicted now, not that it's even in my hands now.\n\nBest thing I can do now is just ignore the girlfriend and her kid. I don't acknowledge the kid, I bought a minifridge for my room so that she doesn't steal my food, I moved my tv and all my consoles from the living room into my room since I hate going out there now anyway. Apart from that business is completely normal. I smoke weed (legal, not against the lease so long as I do it on the balcony), have people over including my girlfriend who I have sex with, practice my instruments as loud as I want during non-quiet hours. I refuse to babysit for any amount of time for any reason. One time I was sleeping and got woken up to my door being knocked on and my phone vibrating. I saw a bunch of texts from roommate saying that they need me to babysit. I lied and said I was out which lead to them having to cancel their plans for the day.\n\nRoommate's girlfriend HATES me and thinks I'm being selfish. Thinks that the baby needs to come first. She has no money and my roommate makes a lot less than me so she thinks I should be responsible for childproofing the house. I told her to take it up with the landlord and that I wasn't wasting my money on her and her kid that isn't even wanted here.\n\nToday I was having my lunch with my mom and vented about this to her and she said that I'm being really mean because even though the circumstances aren't ideal \"babys should come first, always\". Am I really the asshole for wanting to live my life exactly the same as before some unwanted kid started squatting in my house? The way I see it she should go find some other place or if she can't afford one a shelter somewhere.", "The setup: I\u2019ve known this guy for a couple years and we\u2019ve worked together occasionally. We\u2019ve had a couple dates before. We split the bill without any discussion or issue. \n\nHe Snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. I say sure.\n\nI forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point I replied \u201cpizza and a movie\u201d and he replied \u201cyeah see you soon!\u201d It was just an innocent phrase but I didn\u2019t eat that day and assumed we\u2019d get food together.\n\nI show up and he has the movie. I say \u201cso are we getting food?\u201d \n\nHe says \u201cI already ate. But I\u2019m sure you have apps on your phone if you want something.\u201d Then he leaves to go to the bathroom.\n\nI sit there awkwardly. This guy previously talked about being a men\u2019s rights guy. A normal one, not an incel dickhead. He also mentioned he\u2019s low on cash. But isn\u2019t it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? If he was too broke I\u2019d obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn\u2019t the vibe I got since he bragged about a new game he bought. \n\nHe returns and turns on the TV and turns off all the lights. Then he goes into the kitchen, which I assume is to get alcohol. \n\nI call out casually \u201cwhat do you got to drink?\u201d \n\nHe calls back \u201cDo you like tap water?\u201d\n\nThis is not some red pill bullshit. I know this guy, he\u2019s serious. There\u2019s nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. \n\nI call out, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\n\nHe brings me back a glass of tap water. He winks at me.\n\nI\u2019m starving. I haven\u2019t eaten since 8am. \n\nI say \u201cHey, I don\u2019t wanna be weird, but I thought we were getting pizza.\u201d \n\nHe says in a sympathetic tone, \u201cOh. I see. You must have been confused. YOU mentioned the food, not me. I should have cleared that up, I ate earlier. Sorry if that wasn\u2019t clear. We can still get a pizza if you want. Just pick anywhere nearby and order it.\u201d\n\nThis is still kind of shitty to me, but I ignore it and order one large pizza. The pizza shows up. I eat two slices of it. The rest of it sits there the entire movie. He doesn\u2019t offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. He tries to make out with me during the movie. I stop him and feel too weird to be into it. \n\nAfter the movie, I decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. I tell him my feelings and how he\u2019s weird with money and I\u2019m uncomfortable. He feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. There was no bad intention at all. No red pill, no plan, nothing. Just a dude who didn\u2019t think my pizza was his responsibility. \n\nThen he asks me to have sex with him.\n\nI decline. Knowing we still have to work together, I manage to tiptoe out the door.\n\nI don\u2019t expect or need people to buy me things, but I think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners.

She was born a male and started transitioning in her teens. Currently she is pre-op and saving up for gender reassignment surgery. However, you can hardly tell that she used to be a male, save for her voice and height/body frame.\n\nAnyways, yesterday night, a bunch of girls (5 or so) from my classes decided to go to a nearby onsen, or Japanese bath house. Basically, you are expected to get completely naked. Everything is gender segregated. There is a separate men\u2019s section and women\u2019s section.\n\nMy friend who is trans also wanted to go. So we all went as a group. Everyone in our group knows that she is trans and pre-op, but I think everyone was uncomfortable talking about the issue of being naked in the bath house. Finally, when we were in the changing rooms, I quietly suggested to her that she should probably wrap a towel around her hips instead of going completely naked.\n\nShe asked me why and I told her that many of the bathers would probably be a bit alarmed to see male genitalia in the bath house. She got mad at me and said sarcastically, \u201cThanks for your concern.\u201d In the end she opted for the towel, but another friend overheard and said I was out of line for suggesting it. They both thought it was none of my business. I explained that not everyone is so accepting of her body and that I\u2019m just trying to protect her from comments, stares, or worse.\n\nThey avoided me in the bath house after that although my friend did wear a towel around her waist the whole time. There were some looks but not as bad as if she didn\u2019t wear a towel.\n\nI apologized afterwards to my trans friend and said I meant no disrespect.

Part of that is that she has a very large ovarian cyst that requires surgery to remove. The surgery is scheduled and happening soon. Right now, she looks pregnant, which can't be easy on a teenager. \n\nBetween this illness and life in general, Sarah can be... moody and nobody in life is immune to fits of anger. Today at church, some woman decided that Sarah was in fact pregnant, and that it was her CHANCE at a free baby. Sarah went off on her, calling her a \"barren bitch\", among other things, and causing a major scene that left that woman sobbing. \n\nMy wife thinks that Sarah has anger issues, and that we should punish her for not being sensitive. I don't agree.\n\nFirst off, why is that woman entitled to say anything if Sarah WAS pregnant? Infertility doesn't make you exempt from social norms. I recognize that my wife and that woman have suffered, but they don't get to just do whatever. With her medical problems, Sarah will probably be infertile herself, which I think puts her on par on that point. Secondly, Sarah lashed out in a rage due to mental and physical pain while provoked by an outrageous encounter. I don't know that that's the same as having \"anger issues\" or a personality problem. I've had physical fights over less. Maybe that nosy woman needed to learn a lesson, and did.\n\nAITA for letting our daughter get off scot free?\n\nNinja edit: Sarah will have to be on oral birth control for her entire life, and may actually lose at least one ovary in this surgery.

A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew & son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat.

We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n**To those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's NOT true. Aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.**\n\n**To the people telling me that I should have spoken nicely to her, I SAID IN THE FIRST FEW PARAGRAPHS I ALREADY DID THIS. Me and the other flatmates asked her nicely to stop on several occasions and she didn't follow through. What she did was say ''Okay'' and then continue to do the same shit. I'm writing this as a clarification for those comments.**", "Throwaway because my sister knows my Reddit. \n\nI\u2019m getting married next year and I\u2019m so excited about it. My fianc\u00e9 has all his groomsmen picked out, and I\u2019m in the process of asking my bridesmaids. I\u2019d also have liked to include my twin cousins E and A in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. A is a guy and lives a few hours away. E is FTM, which I\u2019m sad to say plays a major role in this AITA. \n\nI drove out two weeks ago to visit A and ask if he\u2019d be willing to be a part of the bridal party. I put together a box of goodies, and a card that said \u201cWill you be a part of my Bride Tribe?\u201d, deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. He was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and E\u2019s ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. I specifically asked him not to mention anything to E because I wanted it to be a surprise.\n\nFast forward to this weekend and I meet E for lunch. I give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. E\u2019s reaction didn\u2019t go as I expected. He got really angry, accusing me of wanting to \u201cfit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold\u201d despite his transition. I tried to explain that I\u2019d picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but I didn\u2019t get the chance because he kept talking over me. I feel like he went off the deep end. He called me bigoted, asked why I wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me \u201cbasic\u201d and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. He left without giving me a chance to really explain.\n\nI guess today E finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he\u2019d be in the bridal party. I drafted a text message saying basically that while he\u2019s still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it\u2019s best if he isn\u2019t a part of the bridal party. My fianc\u00e9 says I should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think I\u2019m being to harsh on E and should have seen this misunderstanding coming. She says I should be more understanding, considering the abuse/discrimination he must face. She says I should give E a second chance and if I don\u2019t it will cause all kinds of family drama.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I refuse to let him be a part of the wedding party?\n\nETA: \nWow, I cannot believe how much this blew up. So I\u2019m going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.\n\nE sent me a text apologizing. His apology was for \u201csnapping at me\u201d. He admitted he was wrong and it was \u201ctotally out of line\u201d and now that he talked to A he knows what I meant and would be in the wedding party \u201cif I\u2019d have him\u201d. Nothing specific was mentioned, and I haven\u2019t sent any response yet. \n\nA also did call me this evening, but I was out to dinner and missed his call. I called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.\n\nALSO, E is a man. He uses the pronouns he/his/him. Just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give ANYONE license to misgender him. If you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for E.", "Just to preface, my husband's brother has two kids, and his parents babysit them at least 3 days a week. I feel like this has kind of set the expectation for frequency of visits with grandparents. \n\nI just had a baby on July 10th, and my husband's mom has been over to visit us 5 times since then. I know she means well, but it's very stressful to have a newborn and to feel like I have to entertain also. It would be different if she was offering to help with something (not that I expect that of visitors, but people visiting new parents usually at least offer). She also seems to conveniently always come while he's napping (he naps for 2+ hours at a time at this point), and she leaves once he starts getting a little fussy, which is frustrating because any rest or chores I could get in while he's asleep don't get done. \n\nShe texted me yesterday asking to come for a visit today. This is the first week my husband is back at work full time, and I'm trying to get in the groove of a new routine. I wrote her back and told her that I'm really not up for visitors this week because I'm getting settled in, and she freaked out and texted my husband asking what she did to offend me. She hasn't talked to me since yesterday after I wrote her, and she basically implied to my husband that we're being selfish keeping her grandson away from her. AITA here?", "I love my boyfriend to death, but we have reached an impasse. I moved into my current house last year after I got a dog, specifically because I wanted her to have a huge backyard to roam around in. I bought her doggy door, and she loved it A few months later my boyfriend moved in from his apartment (though he still has the apartment) and was excited about the backyard because he always wanted chickens. He eventually bought 4 chickens and at first he kept them in an extra large dog cage, but let them free roam for most of the day. That was until we realized that my dog likes to chew there feathers off. So then the chickens had monitored outside time. Then he decided that that wasn't fair to the chickens, and now won't let my dog have free access outside. He keeps her locked in her cage all day when I'm not home, and if she does need to go outside, he makes her put a muzzle on. She can no longer go outside and play with her toys, and my house is way too small for her to have room to play. He's even started scolding me even when I let her walk around inside without the muzzle inside, because he says if I'm not paying attention she might sneak outside and hurt the chickens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's starting to piss me off because the backyard was for her. He doesn't even pay rent on my house. He refuses to make a properly gated area in the yard, even though there's plenty of room. When I remind him that my dog has a right to freedom in my house, he just reminds me on how bad the chickens look after she was done chewing them up. When I suggested him getting rid of the chickens, he says we can't because of all the missing feathers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point I think the only thing I can do is to ask him to leave, and take his chickens. I know he lives in an apartment, but at this point, that's his problem. WIBTA if I asked him to move out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, wow, I got way more responses then I ever dreamed of. I've been trying to read through them all. I feel like despite most saying I would N be TA. I think I agree with the people saying that kicking him out is too extreme. My birthday is next week, I think I'm going to ask if we could build some sort of containment for the chickens for it. Also, yes I know I am a human doormat. Been my whole life, I'm working through it in therapy.", "This just happened at lunch earlier and my one friend is telling me I went too far and making me second guess myself.  \n\nThere\u2019s this girl who is sort of part of my group of friends, but not really.  She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that\u2019s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she\u2019s very insulting, all the time.  It\u2019s seriously like she doesn\u2019t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d a lot. The problem is that she can\u2019t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it\u2019s about her.  \n\nToday at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trans?  I\u2019ve never heard of a guy being anorexic.\u201d  And then, \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive. Just being honest.\u201d   So I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just being honest, you\u2019re being a bitch.\u201d  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, \u201cNo one thinks you\u2019re funny.  The only thing that\u2019s funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.\u201d  \n\nNo one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went too far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  ", "UPDATE: First off I want to say thank you for all the lovely comments, and for people taking the time to weigh in! I tried to keep up with them all and I just couldn\u2019t, so I\u2019m so sorry if I couldn\u2019t get to your comment! \n\nJust to be very clear, I was not asking if I am asshole for standing up for my friend, I stand by my actions 100%. I am trying to figure out if I should have done more to convince my parents to come rather than simply accepting they won\u2019t be there. \n\nI am going to take the advice many of you have suggested and have another sit down with my parents and reiterate my feelings. I will be firm with them and remind them that they are welcome to come but that if they do I expect them to be kind and courteous to all!\n\n\nI will do an update when I speak to them, thank you again reddit x\n\n____________________\n\nI (28F) am marrying my fianc\u00e9 (32M) in March.\n\nI was in my parents home recently and I was telling them about our wedding party, which is going to include a male friend of mine as a groomsman. For some background. This male friend, we\u2019ll call him Stephen, went to high school with me and is a post op trans man. My fianc\u00e9 said he\u2019d love to have Stephen as a groomsman, and i asked Stephen and he was delighted!\n\nThen, I told my parents, and they were like \u201coh we didn\u2019t realise she (yep, she) was going to be actually in the wedding. She\u2019ll be in all the photographs, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate\u201d  So I was obviously instantly mad.They then said that they weren\u2019t going to be comfortable attending and being in all the photographs with her (yep, her again), and that I would need to remove Stephen from the wedding party if I wanted them to come to the wedding. \n\nSo I basically told them that if they weren\u2019t comfortable they didn\u2019t have to come. I left, came home and immediately transferred them the money for the wedding dress. I then get a phone call from my mother telling me that they will pay for the whole wedding if I remove Stephen. Basically bribing us. I just told her I needed space and I hung up.\n\nThat was 3 days ago and I haven\u2019t spoken to them. I\u2019m shocked because they have never spoken ill of Stephen before,! I\u2019m upset that they would show so little respect to someone who is so important to me. I am also upset that they have so little respect for me that they think I would turn my back on a lifelong friend for money.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I should speak to them in a few days when everything has calmed down, or if I should leave it to them. A few people I\u2019ve spoken to have said I\u2019m being a bit of an asshole because they\u2019re my parents, and they have a right to an opinion even if it\u2019s something I don\u2019t agree with. That I\u2019ll regret them not being at my wedding and that realistically it will ruin our relationship. I\u2019ve had aunts and uncles calling me saying that this will tear our family apart and I\u2019m being selfish. A cousin texted me to say that I\u2019m choosing friends over family and that she and her parents won\u2019t be attending if my parents aren\u2019t, and the same for other members of the family. So it\u2019s basically blew up into this huge deal where a good portion of my family will likely not attend either! \n\nMy view is that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s selfish to want to celebrate my day with everyone I love. I feel like the ball is in their court and they have the choice to come or allow their bigotry to stop them attending their only childs wedding! \n\nAlso to be clear I am 100% not removing Stephen from my wedding or taking the money, I\u2019m not considering either option (my fianc\u00e9 is in full agreement). But I just want to know if I\u2019m the asshole for so easily accepting that my parents (and by default a lot of my family) won\u2019t be coming to my wedding?", "Using throwaway \n\n\nSo as the title suggests, I'm currently in the process of adopting my stepdaughter.\n\n\n\nMe and her mom have been married a year and the daughter was the product of a horribly abusive ex-husband. This abuser was still in their lives when we were dating and I used lawyers and the courts to slowly push him out where he has no control over their lives and he is starting to give up fighting the adoption because I'm set to win in a few months.\n\n\n\nNow because of personal issues of our own, my wife has just told me that she wants to file for divorce, but that she wants to wait until after I adopt our kid.\n\n\n\nWhen I told her that I was afraid of adopting our daughter because of the child support I'll have to pay and not being a family anymore (which is why I wanted to in the first place) she had a full panic attack and accused me of leaving her in her abuser's control.\n\n\n\nFor info, the daughter is 5 and calls me dad.\n\n\n\nSo reddit, WIBTA if I told my lawyer to stop the adoption process if I knew my wife was going to leave me after?\n\n\nEdit: Wow this really blew up. To give answers to some repeated questions/comments:\n\nYes I know the ex-husband is abusive for a fact, no this is not about the money her panic attack was about the control her ex has, and I will not even entertain the idea of suing for full custody myself.\n\n\nEdit 2: Went out for a few drinks because I needed them because of all of this. \n\n\nWife had just been diagnosed with some mental struggles and her therapist urged her to allow the meds to take effect before she made a major life decision.\n\n\nI was originally leaning towards adoption because I love that little girl and we get along almost better than her and her mom but after reading the almost 2400 comments at this point and roughly 200-300 pms I've decided to talk to a lawyer when I get home to make an informed decision.", "I was sitting at a table in a coffee shop yesterday when this guy comes in to the shop carrying a guitar and orders a drink. He then happens to choose the space right next to my table to stand and play his guitar while waiting for his order. \n\nI find people who force their music on others very annoying. This guy and his guitar are no different from someone playing music from a Bluetooth speaker in a public area in my mind. But I was lucky in this case - I didn\u2019t have to stick around. Without speaking to the guy or even making eye contact, I stood up and moved to the complete opposite side of the shop to a new table by the exit. \n\nWell the guy must have noticed my displeasure because he stopped playing after I moved. A few moments later he got his drink and moved towards the exit to leave. He opens the door to leave, pauses, then turns to me and says \u201cYou could have just asked me to stop playing. Treat me like a human being.\u201d And then continued out the door before I could respond. \n\nSo this guy is acting like I\u2019m the asshole for not verbally engaging with a stranger who annoyed me. I feel like simply removing myself from the area when possible is usually the right play and leads to less conflict. AITA?", "My daughter (28) has gotten into DPS and fostering, she has had her own child biologically but now plans to foster and adopt children. She has been fostering this 8MO for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they \"sort out\" their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. Although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. My daughter hopes to keep Foster Child. \n\nI am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when I asked to confirm the size of Bio Child, she asked me about Foster Child. I told her I didn't think to include her because she's Foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. She said all grandchildren should be included. My thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. That would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. \n\nShe went off on me and hung up and I am sitting here feeling horrible. I did not mean I do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but I thought I had a clear thought process? \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I do care about this child, I'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. I just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.\n\nFinal edit: I accept judgment and I commented on the person's comment that made me realize why I am in the wrong. They were to the point and just made it a simple question and I understood. \n\nI feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. I did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). Maybe I should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, I apologize. \n\nAccusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. I am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - I'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. \n\nMy daughter and I called her case manager and the photo idea including FC has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting FC or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.\n\nThanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why I was in the wrong.\n\nAnother edit: I accept judgment as I said about my actions... but I stand by my matching flannel idea.

In September, I'm going to move her across the country because she will be starting College at a very good school (she skipped a grade, graduated HS a year earlier than her peers).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week my daughter graduated HS.  We packed up her room (the essentials) from her Mom's house (divorced) as she wont be going back to live there...we're going straight from my house to her College dorm.  A few days ago, my daughter asks me for a ride to my friend Tony's house because she is getting a tattoo.  I was surprised because she never mentioned this to me before. It was definitely framed to me as if this was already approved, she just wanted to go with me to get it done. We stayed up all night looking at designs, coming up with colorways/shading, and deciding on location.  The next day we went to Tony's and she got a small 2\" x 4\" tattoo above her ankle.  I've known Tony since High School, he's been a tattoo artist for 20 years.  I completely trust everything he's associated with when it comes to tattoos.  He even did MY first tattoo when WE were in High School.  The entire experience was actually a blast for me.  I haven't felt that close to my daughter in years, we really bonded over the whole thing.  To see the guy who gave me my first tatt also give her her first made me shed a tear.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course the next day she posts pics online, and her Mom flips her shit.  She calls me screaming about how irresponsible I am.  I honestly didn't know her Mom wouldn't be OK with it.  She has tried her hardest to cut me out of all decision-making about Daughter, so the norm is they make the decisions amongst themselves and I'm just sometimes along for the ride (and to pay).  She's also cut me out of multiple milestones in Daughter's life.  Graduations, performances, games, etc.  Until Daughter was old enough to tell me directly, I was never invited so I missed a lot of moments.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously Daughter was aware of this, which is why she simply stated to me \"I'm getting a tattoo\" instead of asking me.  I definitely reprimanded her for misleading me, but otherwise, whats the big deal?  Wife has been OK with her having sex since 13, picked her own High School and College, is fine with her moving across the country in a few months to attend and live by herself.  Why are we acting like she is not capable of deciding this on her own?  Would it be better if she gets it done 5 months from now from some shitty kid doing tatts out his dorm room with used needles?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMom is livid.  She threatened to call the police.  Threatened to pick up Daughter and bring her back to her house.  Tried to make me take her to get the tattoo removed.  None of this is happening.

My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. \n\nMy sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. \n\nNow, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. I didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.\n\nSo I left, and went for the bus. Literally five minutes later I get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the ER because she cracked her head open on the living room table. Apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. \n\nI am absolutely raging at my sister. I don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. She argues that I 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which I feel I didn't. She says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but I feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.\n\nAITA?", "My friend is obviously gay.

I was devastated to  hear her go through this.  Despite all the efforts, she was kept on a ventilator (per her parents wishes) and never woke up. \n\nAfter months of visiting Anna, sitting by her, I was getting drained.

So after a lot of therapy and reaffirming my belief and faith in God, I put myself back out there. I eventually met a new girl who I loved (Katie), and I saw a lot of traits in her that I saw in my ex. \n\nA few days ago (May 2), the parents decided to pull her off life support. At first I was extremely upset, but realized Anna would want this; to end her suffering and her families). Katie knew about Anna and it was no surprise to her I wanted to be there when she was taken off life support. When I got there, I kissed Anna's forehead, ran my hands through her hair, and told her I loved her. After the the doctors removed her tube, it was extremely emotional for all the family and me. I kissed her again (on her lips, and just whispered again \"I love you). \n\nAt the funeral I gave her a eulogy (which Katie attended) and told Anna again \"I love you.\"\n\nAfter the funeral, Katie was angry with me. She asked what I mean't when I said \"I love you, Anna.\" Then I told her about the kiss  because I felt guilty. Now, Katie is now super pissed at me. She is staying with her parents and said I cheated on her. This was not my intention at all though, I just wanted Anna to know (if she was even conscious) that I loved her, and would see her again. The kiss was not 'romantic' or 'sexual', it was just a final goodbye, I wanted more than to just touch her hand once last time. \n\nAITA for this?", "My fiance (31m) and I (28f) have two girls aged 4&2. Last year I had a stillborn baby daughter. I said I never wanted to be pregnant again. It hit me really hard and I've never known pain like it. \n\nApparently, your super fertile after a loss and I ended up falling pregnant immediately after our loss and I'm currently 8 month pregnant with a boy. Something my fiance really wanted.\n\nI hate being pregnant. Never enjoyed it. I hate even more how long I've been pregnant due to the back to back pregnancies. I'm miserable and I never want to be pregnant again.\n\nIn the unlikely event the baby I'm carrying now does also die I never want to be pregnant again. If the baby lives I never want to be pregnant again. I honestly can't explain how much I hate being pregnant. I love babies, children etc. Not pregnancy. My eldest two girls and this baby are all c sections which is tough. I gave up work to be a sahm but I'm looking forward to when this one starts school and I can get back to work.\nI hate how sick, tired and achey I feel. I'm short tempered with my other children. I'm fat and saggy. I poop constantly. My mental healths taken a complete beating - I've been in counselling for nearly a year now and feeling better though. \n\nAnyway. My consultant offerered to cut my fallopian tubes during my next c section making me infertile. I said yes of course, just check with my fiance.\nHe is very against it. I don't feel comfortable doing something permanent that effects him too without his support but equilly ill never forgive him if I fall pregnant again. \n\nHe says I'm making a decision based on anger that's I've essentially been pregnant for 14 months now.\n\nWIBTA if I agreed to be steralised - taking away also his choice of having any more children - because that's what I want?\n\nAlso to add, we've discussed me using the coil but there's no birth control that's 100% effective.\n\nEdit: this has gotten more attention than I thought it would. I haven't had the chance to read all replies yet as been doing kids baths dinner etc, still need to get them to bed so will read every reply later.\nJust to answer a few questions that have come up so far. I wasn't sure how much info to add in my original post to not be rambly. \n\nFiance had always said as one of 4 he loved the madness and would want 4. I always said 4 was too many but we said we'd see how we feel after 3. We had never anticipated a still born and that steralisiation would be an option.\n\nThis past year he's been my absolute rock. He also lost a baby, but he had to hold it together while I fell apart. He's a fantastic father. This isn't a walk away from our family matter.\n\nHe's a bit of a stereotypical man in that he doesn't do talking about feelings, this is how he's always been and I accept that. He has so many other fantastic qualities. An example would be when choosing the music for our daughters funeral. He simply refused to pick. It upset him too much. You could say this is an ass hole move, however while I sat inside crying he was outside on the tranmpoline with our other 2 young children making them shriek with laughter, protecting them as best as he could.\n\nI know in a way this is above this sub, because he's not an asshole, but I didn't want relationship advice. I just wanted to know if I would be crossing a line by doing it without his full support.\n\nIf I say I'm getting it done, he won't stop me. But he will resent me. If I don't get it done, I will resent him. \n\nHis main concern is that its extra surgery with extra risks. Second that I'm not my usual self (I'm not - I am a raging hormonal mess, with a dose of ptsd, anxiety and depression to boot thanks to our loss - however I have a fantastic counsellor and things have greatly improved). Third he says there's other forms of contraception that isn't permanent. Forth is my age. \n\nAnd I've had 2 c sections. 1 emergency, 1 planned. Our stillborn was delivered naturally as she was premature and small so not the same risks. I have my third c section booked for the end of the month. I need to give an answer on Wednesday if I want the tubal tie at the same time and we are still in disagreement, so one of us will be upset. I wanted to see if I was being an asshole for choosing my choice, of permanent steralisiation over his suggestion of the coil. \nSo far it seems from comments that I'm not and I really appreciate all the replies. I will read them all xxx\n\nEdit 2. Guys I was asking if I would be an asshole not if fiance is an asshole and I'm beginning to feel very protective over him with some of the comments. I'm not a baby factory in the same way he's not a sperm doner. We love each other and respect each other we just have a difference of opinion on a huge matter and we've ran out of time. Whilst I'm really pleased it seems everyone is agreeing with me he's a good guy too. Everything he does is for us. He's hardworking, loving and fun. He helps me with the kids after a day of manual work. He does baths and the park. He rubs my back, sends me off for baths when I ache. Let's me sleep in, or nap due to pregnancy tiredness.\nLeaving us over this wouldn't of even entered his mind nor is it a concern of mine. We survived a stillbirth while raising 2 other young children, as a team, filling their life with joy despite the pain. We can survive anything if we've made it through the last 18 odd months x", "I have a son thats entering 8th grade and a daughter thats entering 9th grade.  Both of them have always been bookworms.  Very studious and cerebral, just like their Dad.  I also played sports all through school and I value the experience that brings.  I've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  I tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  We dont know til we try?  Even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   My wife insisted I back off.  Fair enough.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow my daughter is entering High School and wants to become a cheerleader.  She has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  She actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  But one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  She's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in High School because she was \"a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said no.  I dont appreciate that reasoning.  My wife explained that I dont \"know what its like to be a girl in high school\" and I say OK?  Hows that relevant?  I also dont appreciate cheerleading.  Its too dangerous.  Girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  We don't have the insurance to cover it.  Lastly, I dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  Those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  My wife says I'm focusing on the bad and not the good.  Most girls dont get injured.  I'm the pervert because I'm making it sexual.  I pushed for her to join a sport.  I let my son play sports.  She'll have a much better high school experience.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still like...fuck that shit.  My reasoning is sound.  She's not in it for the right reasons, and the benefits are lame.", "A couple of years ago, I was in a life threatening accident. I was really lucky and I made it alive. My wife and I planned a vacation just before that. And she decided to take her best friend on the vacation while I was in the hospital. That was a week long trip to Greece. \n\nShe came back after a week and did not stop talking about how amazing the vacation was. Apparently she did that to help me vicariously enjoy the vacation. I was really pissed. My sister and my family supported me. But my wife did not. She later told me that she was too  stressed and depressed to be around me and watch me suffer. \n\nNow, my wife is down with flu. And I've been helping her. But I think I should help her vicariously enjoy Europe because it's one of her favorite destinations. I just want her to know how I felt. Of course, I won't go, but I plan on acting like I did. When I told my sister this, she told me that I should not get back at her and forgive her and lead by example. I don't think so. I think I'm feeling the stress now. WIBTA here?\n\nEdit: So this blew up and I'm getting many responses. I only stayed for my daughter because she was a teen. She moved out now. My wife will move out after I divorce her. Just wanted her to get a feel of why I divorced her.", "My niece is kind of... a useless intern at the moment. She was super sheltered by her mother, my brother travels for work... so she has no real life skills.   \nI own a business and took Ally \\[18\\] under my wing. She lives in my basement apartment \\[I live above her\\] and I am pretty much building an adult from the ground up. Everything from how to dress in the workplace to how to use a computer properly outside of Facebook and Instagram.   \nIt's working. It's just frustrating for Ally because she should know a lot of this stuff. But her mom is very, very controlling. I expect I am going to do this with my other niece Savannah when she graduates in a few years.   \nBut it's working out well. Ally is going to start community college in September. But until then I am having her sit in my office and do various small tasks, take an online Microsoft Word tutorial, and catch up on various life goals.   \nI have been running my own business for six years now. I took it over from my Mother when she retired. My brother has no interest in the business, though he was offered some stake.   \nMy mother ran the business for 37 years before I took it over. She hired a woman named Belladonna \\[54F\\] who has worked there for 24 years. As such, Belladonna feels she is pillar for the company and has asked to become a manager. She has tried to take on managerial roles before, but I wouldn't give her that job if someone paid me.   \nShe is a little snarky, but I had no issue with it. Until I caught her calling Ally \"Cinderella\" and \"Princess.\" She was also ordering Ally to get her coffee. When Ally said she was working on something, Belladonna told her \"well, I guess you just sit down and do nothing then.\"   \nI fired her on the spot.   \nMy Mother thinks I was an asshole for doing that. But I don't tolerate people who think being older means they have a right to be snarky. I told people what Ally was doing at the job, and that she was not an intern. She was simply my niece assisting me on stuff I needed help with.   \nAITA?   \n", "So, i'm in the middle of a shitstorm and need some advice on if i'm wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister is getting married in less that 3 weeks. I haven't been involved in the planning as I have my own life but from what my mom has relaid to me it's been a nightmare. My sister want's a \"fancy\" wedding and is micro-managing everything. I have no idea how normal this is but from what i've heard she broke down crying when her fiance bought the wrong shade of white napkins. Her and both my and the grooms parents have invested a lot of money into this too the tune of over 50k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion I think the whole ordeal is ridiculous but it's not really my place to say anything. At least until yesterday. A email was sent out to everyone invited to the wedding with \"attendance requirements\". These requirements were a joke. Some of them were just nonsensical like what color ties are and aren't allowed or that no one can talk to the wife or groom alone. But some were absurd like the fact that no one is supposed to take pictures except the photographer for the whole event, no facial hair will be allowed or you will not be pictured, or that any women with shoulder length or longer hair must have it cut or wear it in a pony tail. The worst though were the \"gift requirements\". According to the email a gift of 300$ value or more MUST be given (or $250 cash) or you will not be allowed into the venue. The email also ends with \"Those who choose not to follow these rules will be asked to leave. Please think of the bride and groom's wishes during this stressful time\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a joke, right? Like I can understand micromanaging but that's just absurd. I called my mom to make sure this was not a late April fools joke and it was real. I told her that I won't be going because of this. That was wrong apparently because my sister has been blowing me up saying that I'm being selfish and that i'm ruining \"her day:. My parents agree with her and say i'm being an asshole. My parents have told me that they will pay for my gift but I still think that all of these rules are a joke.\n\nWould I be an ass if I skipped out on the wedding?", "My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant.\n\nAn stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of\u2013 75%) her private high school tuition. It had always been my husband who pays for An's expenses.\n\nWhen An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. I have been separating some money for this purpose, too.\n\nMy husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.\n\nI laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy.\n\nAn's mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of \"all the experience\". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.\n\nI am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money I've been saving in other stuff if An decides to carry on with the pregnancy. I have NOT and will NOT make the ultimatum of \"terminate or I'll stop paying your tuition\", but I will tell her that I won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. I don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. I firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. Money will go to some of the child's expenses and I will give no more. An can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.\n\nMy husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An and I am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit/Commonly asked questions:** Ann will NOT stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. I will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but I also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (I still need to make a budget, but I don't think I will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).\n\nNo, I will NOT make an ultimatum. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ANN ABOUT THIS SITUATION. I plan on telling her I can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. She STILL will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. If father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.\n\nI will definitely NOT pay for the private university. The country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. I AM NOT CLOSING HER EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS. I may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to LSE, for example) but I am not giving her the worst.\n\nFinally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. Parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. That would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.\n\n**Another edit because forgot to add:** Ann was supposed to be on the pill. Gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. She stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the \"natural\" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. Husband and I have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but I'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point I just want to fist fight bio mom.", "Hi all, I\u2019ll try to make this as brief and unbiased as possible.\nI  met my bf a year ago, we have always had protected sex ( I\u2019m on the pill and he wears a condom). I have no idea what happened but I still managed to get pregnant. I immediately decided to get an abortion.\nI asked my bf if he could come and support me through the procedure. He said he didn\u2019t want to take a day off. Full disclosure if it gives insight: he works from home taking contracts as a programmer, makes $150k a year and can take off whenever he feels like it.\n\nSo whatever, he told me he wasn\u2019t coming and that I had to take care of it. This was a week ago. The procedure was yesterday and it went as well as can be expected. I went to his house afterwards and he told me he had a surprise for me: it was a small, child sized bowl with cutesy animals on it. I thanked him but mentioned that this was maybe not the best gift as I just had a tough day and was emotional at best. \nHe then told me he had a wonderful day with his family and proceeded to show me a video of his father and nephew doing egg hunts together and the father teaching the nephew to wash his hands, etc.\nSo I immediately started bawling because I just terminated a pregnancy ( it wasn\u2019t wanted and I don\u2019t regret it, but it doesn\u2019t mean I feel sensitive about it). He became very cold and asked me to stop crying, saying that I was overreacting and he was just trying to make me feel better. He didn\u2019t apologize and we went to bed upset. I woke up in the middle of the night because I was cramping and sore, so I went on his couch and had a good cry. Apparently that woke him up because he came to ask me if I was going to continue crying for long and told me to turn off the lights ASAP because I was being inconsiderate.\n\nAITAH? I feel like he doesn\u2019t give a rats ass about me and is being disrespectful, he says it\u2019s the \u2018pregnancy hormones\u2019 making me whiny.\n\nETA: thank you all for your judgement and messages. I\u2019m going to have a conversation w my bf tonight. To those who think he wanted to keep it: he made it clear (explicitly) that he didn\u2019t want it. Regardless, I want to at least understand his motivations. I will try to post an update when this is all over. Thank you again.\nAlso don\u2019t waste your time calling me a baby killer, I\u2019m 100% pro choice and would do it again in a heartbeat. If you can\u2019t understand why, then you\u2019re not someone I want to engage with anyway.", "Ok so this is kind of a weird situation. My wife is one of those super prim and proper chicks. Like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. You don't ever catch her doing anything \"impolite\", whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. Even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. I've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter. \n\nShe had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. She wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so I had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about \"needing privacy to pee\", I'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done. \n\nWell she had been in there for a while, and I'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. So I went in there and sure enough she was. I teased her and was like, \"See! I knew you shit too!\" She got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so I left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. She was real emotional so I shut up about it for a while. Well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so I figured I could finally tease her again.\n\nEvery once in a while I'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and I'll be like \"still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. Man that was awful, i could smell it from in here!\" She always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. Well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when I brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. I told her it's just funny because it's the only time I got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. But I kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said I was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. So AITA? I'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her.\n\nEdit: Welp, I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I guess the general consensus is that I am TA, so I guess I'll try to tone it down for now until she has more time to calm down over it.", "Yeah so I\u2019m basically Joey from Friends before anyone states the obvious. I really really hate sharing food when I order out at restaurants or takeout. I always order just enough for myself so when someone grazes off my plate it makes me unreasonably upset. \n\nSo my wife is a TERRIBLE food snatcher. She always says she\u2019s not that hungry and orders a small side or nothing at all, then slowly devours the food I\u2019ve ordered. So many times I\u2019ve ordered steak and fries just to end up competitively eating fries with her as we both race to get the last fry. I ask her to order her own stuff but she\u2019ll say she\u2019s not that hungry or my food looks better, etc. \n\nAnyways in the past year I\u2019ve found a good trick where I simply order dishes with one ingredient she hates (cilantro, anchovies, carrots, or chilies) and she won\u2019t touch any of it. Recently some family members discovered I do this and called me a massive asshole. They called me childish for not sharing food with a spouse but honestly I\u2019m just sick of not being able to eat a whole meal. AITA?\n\n**Edit**: To those asking if I\u2019ve told her to stop, I do, all the time, but it\u2019s honestly worse because then she sits there and eyes my food sadly. Or she\u2019ll sigh and push her own plate around and ask, sadly \u201cso how\u2019s your food? It looks really good...\u201d Or she waits until I\u2019m taking a break to ask me multiple times if I\u2019ve finished and if she could now have a bite, in the saddest voice possible like she\u2019s begging for scraps. It just feels super disconcerting when someone is so focused on me eating my meal.\n\nI like just getting something she has no interest in cause then I can eat in peace, and that usually forces her to order something else for herself as well.", "I have a tattoo of my sons name which I got when he turned 1. I\u2019ve never had a tattoo after that.

I got his name because he was premature and they told us he had a high probability of dying, the fact he didn\u2019t was a medical miracle.

We live together in an awkwardly shaped apartment with a long, narrow living room and a tiny bedroom. As a result, our dresser is in the living room.\n\nAfter work, I like to come home, greet my boyfriend who's usually relaxing on the couch, and change into my gym clothes. While I'm changing in the living room, we usually talk about our day. Well today, I started telling him about an annoying co-worker while I was topless. Out of nowhere, he abruptly stops me and curtly says, \"don't talk to me when you're naked\". I was really taken aback by this. Embarrassed, I went into the bedroom to dress in peace.\n\nAngrily, I came out and asked my boyfriend why he suddenly had a problem with me being naked. Before I get into his reasoning, I will admit that I am naked quite a bit. For instance, after I shower I like to do a naked Kermit style dance to dry off in front of him. Anyway, his discomfort is that seeing me naked all the time makes it less special when we have sex. He even mentioned that this issue came up in Seinfeld and that Jerry would side with him. I don't know about this, I feel like I have a right to be naked, but I don't want him to feel uncomfortable either.\n\nAnyway, should I let my fur flag fly or AITA??\n\nUPDATE: Before I dive in, you guys really came through with the solid advice! Thank you! Ok, so after this incident I decided to cool off and go to the gym. When I got home my boyfriend sheepishly greeted me. I coldly said \"hi\" and sat on the couch to play on my phone. While I'm sitting, he walks over to me and without saying a single word, begins to start stripping! He gets butt naked, picks up my free weights and starts doing lunges, squats, bicep curls, you name it! I watched him in silence until we both couldn't take it anymore and started laughing. He then apologized, saying he doesn't have a problem with my nudity, he just doesn't like to have prolonged conversations when I'm naked. I understand where he's coming from, so we agreed that any conversation longer than 5 minutes will require a shirt. Tough, but fair.\n\nThank you again for your helpful comments! They were really thoughtful and made me think deeper about how I was making him uncomfortable. In terms of saying that me being naked all the time makes sex less special, he said it was a dumb comment that he only said in anger. I accept this.\n\nI'm also a bit obsessed with all the Seinfeld comments. Jerry is absolutely an asshole and using him to argue your point is hilarious. Now Kramer on the other hand...\n\nAnd thank you to everyone who supports my Kermit dance! I will confidently dance dry after my shower tonight. But for no longer than 5 minutes. I know the rules.", "My wife gets upset when I do this but I feel like I'm in the right here. If we are at a bar or a party, we usually go our own separate ways to socialize.

So I'll head over to where she's at and grab her, give her a kiss and compliment her. Something like \"She's so funny. That's why I married her.\" Then I leave so she can continue talking. Almost every time, the guy ends up leaving after I do. She's never really flirting with these guys, just talking sports or politics. But she's beautiful and very smart and she has a knack for being very personable so they assume she is flirting. She says all she is trying to do is have a conversation with a stranger but I'll I'm doing is letting people know we are married. If it was just a conversation, they should still be able to talk to her even though she's taken. AITA?", "I am a butch lesbian and for the past 12 years I have had a short, men's style haircut. I'm not talking about a pixie cut that requires a lot of styling and time. My sides are buzzed fairly short with the top a bit longer. It usually only takes about 10- 15 minutes for me to get a haircut. During that time every salon I've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut. This has always annoyed me and I don't enjoy paying almost double what men with the exact same haircut as me pay.\n\nRecently I moved and yesterday I went to a new shop for my monthly trim and I decided to try something new. I asked if I could be charged the $22 for a men's cut rather than $40 for a woman's cut. The woman at the counter looked like I slapped her. She called a manager and the stylist over and they seemed shocked by the suggestion. They talked about it among themselves and then told me it wasn't possible. I pushed back and explained my reasoning and all they would say was they don't charge by style. 12 years of frustration boiled over and I ended up leaving. I was never rude or mean, but I still feel bad that I wasted a stylist's appointment.\n\nAITA for asking? Leaving? Being annoyed at what I see as a double standard?\n\nI've thought about going to a barber, but I live in a conservative part of the country and I worry about a negative reaction there and every salon I've ever gone to explicitly caters to men as well.", "My father in law is the king of passive aggressive comments and passing judgement on other people's lives. He particularly disapproves of the fact that I work, send the kids to daycare, and expect my husband to contribute to the household equally in spite of the fact that he makes more than I do. If my father in law had it his way, I would be waiting on my husband and kids hand and foot at all times. \n\nHis recent tactic of snarky comments has been to say that everything we own or pay for is done with my husband's money. If I buy my husband a gift, FIL says, \"Is it really a gift if you're spending his money?\" If I pay for my FIL's coffee, he says, \"well, really your husband is paying for this.\" It's annoying and frustrating. I tried being snarky back, didn't work. I tried talking to him about it and he just pretended he didn't know what I was talking about.\n\nThe final straw was that my kids have started saying it. I mentioned to my husband that I was going to get my hair cut and my son pipes up with, \"so you're going to go waste dad's money on yourself?\" and both kids start laughing. My husband told them that they were being rude and they defended themselves by saying that grandpa says it all the time! Apparently he's taken to telling the kids behind my back that I'm wasting my husband's money on myself every time that I buy anything for myself. One of my kids straight up called me greedy and selfish.\n\nI'm livid and I want to ban my father in law from seeing my kids until he admits to what he's been doing, apologizes, and actually stops doing it. My husband is onboard for the most part, but his mother and siblings are telling us that this is just how he is and it's not that bad and we can just teach our kids otherwise. Are we assholes if we kick him out of our kids lives until he stops being such a jerk and poisoning my kids against me?", "Okay hear me out.\n\nSo today I took my baby over to my parents\u2019 house for dinner, without my wife. We have a five month old, she\u2019s home with the kid all day while I\u2019m at work and needed a break\u2014so I went with the baby. Works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and I bring her home a doggie bag with dinner.\n\nOn the way home, around 10pm, I made a left in a no left. It saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. It\u2019s a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger.\n\nOf course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and I get pulled over. Here in Ontario, \u2018disobey a sign\u2019 is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how I know\u2026).\n\nBaby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. So just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, I just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. Baby woke up and starting screaming. When I rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way.\n\nBaby was perfectly fine. I gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. We\u2019re home now and she\u2019s asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. I felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so I moved $100 (what I would have paid for the ticket) into the kid\u2019s RESP (university fund).\n\n\u2018My wife was absolutely furious when she found out\u2019 is what I might say if I was a complete idiot and had told her.\n\nAITA?", "My wife recently decided she doesn't want to give oral anymore. Her reason is that she doesn't like it and so doesn't think she should have to do it. Ofcourse she's right, no one can force her to give oral, and she's entirely within her right to refuse oral to me.\n\nThat said, I've always hated having Friday night dinners with my in-laws. My in-laws are nasty judgemental people and for the last 10+ years I've spent almost every Friday night - when I should be relaxing from a long week's work - with people that I honestly detest on some level. Why do I do this? Because it makes my wife happy and I want her to be happy.\n\nSo I told my wife that's fine - she doesn't have to, but that I'd also like to stop doing something which I hate - spending every friday with my in-laws.\n\nShe says I'm an asshole and that the situations are different. I disagree, we're both stopping something we hate despite it making the other happy. I think we're both within our right to do so and neither of us are assholes.\n\nAITA?", "So theres not too much to say, I guess I'm more curious in others opinions on this.  I am an approx 22.5 year old man, I recently snagged a really really good job.  I work as a corporate level administrator in the trucking industry.  It's been a pretty sweet gig so far and have no complaints as of yet (2 months in). I would also like to preface the following with saying that I work with a very diverse staff of coworkers who are all as professional as they can be, rarely is it that someone cant pull their own weight. \n\nAbout a week ago I was walking through the parking lot to my car after the end of the day, and I was looking at the sunset through the chain link fence.  As my eyes darted around i happened to notice a pink metal plate bolted onto the fence, I thought to myself \"woah, what's that and how did i not notice it before?\" So i started reading it and I was immediately greeted with slight disappointment.  Basically, it read as follows \"FEMALE EMPLOYEE PARKING SPACE ONLY!\" with a large symbol in the middle of the sign which is also seen on women's public bathrooms.  \n\nNow, let me clarify I am not \"Irate\" or \"fuming\" about it, but I dont really buy into the whole chivalry, white knighting culture that the men of previous generations upheld *fedora intensifies*.  I even asked my fiance when I got home, just to get a female insight on it.  She said she thought it was stupid.  I guess I'm just coming from the territory of you can show that your a diverse company dedicated to equality, without making tedious or unimportant decisions like special parking.  Just my two cents on it though. ", "So my girlfriend and I recently got engaged, and I figured it would be nicer to have her pick out her own ring rather then me guessing what she likes. \nNow I already know my girlfriend loves shiny things, but now she is absolutely adamant that she wants a real diamond ring. Personally I don't like the idea of shelling out so much money for a piece of jewelry with an artificial high price. So instead I offered to buy her one that was lab-grown, as it's way cheaper but also doesn't involve shady business practices and labor. \n\nMoney isn't an issue, it's really about the ethics for me. I do not like the idea of buying her something that potentially harmed someone in the making of it for our wedding. But she thinks I'm being stingy for not buying her a \"real\" diamond. We've already gotten in a few arguments over this so now I wanted to ask you guys if I should just suck it up or not.", "I stopped by a local coffee place after work today. There was a woman behind me in line with a toddler, the kid was sweet and saying \"hello\" to everyone in line and genuinely brightened my day. \n\nWhile I was standing near the cash register waiting for my order, the woman stepped up and ordered a $4 coffee. I kindly offered to pay and she seemed so grateful and even thanked me twice. Right after, she turned back to the cashier and said, \"in that case, you can add two extra shots and a blueberry muffin.\"\n\nI was so taken aback, I immediately told the cashier that I changed my mind and she could pay for her own order. I walked over, picked up my drink and left without another word. \n\nAITA for reneging on my offer? \n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone so much for responding. The only thing I'd like to clarify is that I felt bad about it afterwards. She could have intended to pay for the add-ons, it could have been a joke, etc. I didn't communicate with her very well because I fell into a trap of assuming the worst. If she looked at me expectantly to pay, I would clearly not be an asshole. It was more my quick response of which I was unsure. ", "I\u2019m a \u201csmall\u201d chested woman. Not even that small, I like my boobs. There is this \u201cfriend\u201d of mine who has like F cup breasts. \n\nFor some reason, she likes picking on my breasts. She is always saying passive aggressive stuff like \u201cwell, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll ever feel real back pain, considering how small your tits are\u201d, one time she picked up my bra when we were in the changing room after gym and said \u201cDo you really fit in this? God your tits are tinier than I thought!\u201d; \u201cCan you really not pick up stuff with your underboob? That\u2019s insane how small they are!\u201d; \u201cHow will you nourish kids if you ever have them lmao\u201d; \u201cIf I were your boyfriend, I\u2019d be soooo unsatisfied with them\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m not really confrontational, I just shrugged off her comments and told her more than once they\u2019re not funny. Yesterday it was more, to my liking, a direct insult. I was just minding my own god damned business doing some work when she asked me:\n\nHer: Hey OP, would you use shoes if you had no legs?\nMe: Well, depends if I had prosthetics or not. \nHer: But would you if you had no prosthetics? \nMe: I don\u2019t think so, why? \nHer: Then why do you wear a bra? Hahaha they are so small. \n\nI was tired at the moment. I admit I snapped, I told her \u201cat least my breasts aren\u2019t saggy like a pair of rotten melons.\u201d \n\nShe got angry. Like I just wished death upon her mother; father, and firstborn. She started crying and saying I\u2019m an asshole for picking on such a sensitive subject for her ????? \n\nMy boyfriend thinks I was not an asshole and technically I wasn\u2019t talking about her tits so that\u2019s shit she took upon herself. Some of our mutual female friends told me I should apologize, her boyfriend told me that\u2019s a sensitive subject for her and I should apologize. She sent me a text that she will be mad at me until I properly apologize to her. \n\nI don\u2019t want to apologize as I think I was not the asshole here. Play bitch games win bitch prizes, or as we\u2019d say in my language, this woman \u201cse lleva y no se aguanta\u201d. \n\nBut why would I be here if it not were to ask beautiful Reddit... AITA?\n\n\n**EDIT** we are *friends* because we work in the same place and she referred me to the gym we\u2019re working out together right now and the women I\u2019m working out with. I do not share my personal stuff with her nor do I think we have a friendship per se. We are more acquaintances than friends. She does tell me some of her personal stuff but it\u2019s not reciprocated. \n\n**EDIT 2** also, the \u201ctechnically I wasn\u2019t talking about her tits\u201d part comes from my boyfriend, not me. I know I went to the jugular with that shit. \n\n**EDIT 3** Thanks for the silver and gold, kind redditors! I didn\u2019t expect this to get that much attention but here we are. \n\nI replied to her message saying that I would apologize if she did too. She told me she had nothing to apologize as I *don\u2019t have big tits nor suffer like her* BITCH WHAT. She also started bitching about my boyfriend and how he is a bad influence for me ???? NO ONE EVEN MENTIONED HIM. I think this bitch has a sick crush on me or has her head way up her ass so she tries desperately to not be the one in the wrong. \n\nI took advise from here too and told her to stop making comments about my breasts or I\u2019d have to go to HR. You know, culturally (in my country) it\u2019s not that of an offense for women to speak about other women\u2019s breasts. She told me I was a crybaby and a weakass softie. \n\nI\u2019ll post screenshots (with translation) when I\u2019m in my computer so I can edit that shit. Thanks everyone for the support. ", "The computers at my job are fairly crappy and require several minutes to boot. After turning them on I have to wait a couple of minutes for them to get to the password screen, then a few more minutes before they're all loaded up and ready to go. Typically I come in, turn them on, check my phone messages, hit the head (long commute to work) then get going. It's around 5 minutes max. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this morning he calls a meeting and announces that going forward he wants everyone there 10 minutes before their required start time in order to boot their machines and starts citing how much this so-called \"time theft\" is costing him and etc. I replied that if he wants me to come in at 8:50 instead of 9 that's fine, but the ten minutes has to come off the end of the day unless he's going to pay the 50 minutes of OT a week. I also pointed out that when he opens the building at 8am he could spend two minutes turning on everyone's (three people) computers, which would cut the wait time in half at least. Then I said that my time is as valuable to me as his is to him and even though it's \"just ten minutes\" they're MY ten minutes, not his and I'm not interested in donating my time for nothing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo he was all pissy all day and everyone else is acting like I'm the asshole but I vehemently disagree. They're work computers and turning them on is part of the job, whether he likes it or not. Anyone else think he's the asshole here?", "Every summer my community has a cookoff competition. Usually about 20-30 individuals or couples try to cook xyz and then they can win a portion of the entry ticket fees while the rest go into the community parks. It's not summer yet but they decided to do it early. This year it was pasta sauce. I've been going to these for years, ever since my wife and I moved here but this is the first time I entered as a competitor. It was earlier today.\n\nOne of the other competitors, I know her somewhat (only in passing) is a 15 or 16 year old with Asperger's Syndrome and autism. I don't know much about this condition evidently. I'll call her Jessica. I guess a lot of people got wind of her being a part of the competition that we had news crews here taping her to put on the news. We've never had this before as far as I know.\n\nTo make the story short, I won the competition. And $1,500. There's no second or third place prize, it's winner takes all. My wife and I were in shock because I like to think of myself as a decent home cook and take pride in my pasta sauce specifically, but to win a contest? We were tickled pink. \n\nWe celebrated for about twenty minutes when the event organizers came to us. You might be able to guess where this is going, but they asked if we'd give our prize to Jessica as a \"gesture of good will\". They said they'd get some publicity since news reporters are here. We obviously said no, $1,500 is a lot of money. So they then asked if we'd like to split it, 50/50, with Jessica. Likewise we said no.\n\nI guess some nearby patrons overheard the conversation and chimed in. Apparently we're assholes and jerks for not sharing the prize at least. After a few moments, there might have been 10 other people all clamoring to us about how we're a disgrace to the community, etc.\n\nWe had to leave and haven't collected our winnings yet. We're meant to tomorrow from the mayor's office. I can't even imagine what's going to happen tomorrow.\n\nAre we the assholes for not splitting our winnings with a disabled child for a cooking competition?", "Last year I took in my nephew, who is now almost 17, after my sister and her husband kicked him out because of his sexuality. I'm a single parent of two kids of my own, 15 year old girl and 12 year old boy, and we live in another state so it was a big transition for everyone but I felt it was important. I should also note that I left the church of latter day saints (Mormon) 8 years ago and moved out of Utah. It's part of the reason I am divorced. \n\nAnyway, last night I took the kids out to a local carnival and my nephew ran into his \"boyfriend\" there. I put boyfriend in quotes because they aren't really dating. In my family they would refer to it as \"crushing on each other\" instead. The \"boyfriend\" joined our group and my nephew took a picture of him with my two kids and posted it on social media saying \"Nothing better than hanging out with the people I love.\" I thought it was innocent enough. He never said they were dating and you can love your friends, but another one of my nieces saw it and reported it to my nephew's mom (my sister).\n\nMy sister is furious. She said that she should have been notified that he was dating. When I told her that they aren't even dating she said that she should have been told they were interested in each other. Here's the thing though. There is no expectation that kids need to tell their parents who they are crushing on and my sister never felt the need to know when she thought her son was straight. Now that she knows he's gay I don't think the rules should change to where she has to know if he has a crush on his friends. \n\nI also told her that she doesn't really have a say anymore. I have legal guardianship over my nephew. He's living in my home. She kicked him out. She started crying after I said this and told my family so I've been answering phone calls all morning hearing about how awful of a person I am for saying that to my sister. I don't see it but maybe I'm wrong. Should I have told her even though they aren't serious? Was it a low blow to say the things I said to her? Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone. I feel like an asshole now for asking this question. It probably seems obvious to many people but this is all brand new to me. Walking away from the church and my ex husband was the hardest thing I ever had to do and I think I still carry a lot of guilt from that. My kids don't get to see a lot of my family or their dad's family because we aren't welcome for walking away. To have my whole family pissed at me again really hurt. I don't know anything about raising a 17 year old in general and am only now getting caught up on what it means to have a gay child so it's a learning process.\n\nEdit2: I completely understand why people think this is a validation post and don't blame the mods if they have to delete this. I want to be super clear that wasn't what I intended to do. When you grow up in the environment I did it's hard to feel confident in any decision you make. Everything I did from the time I started talking to leaving my husband and the church has been questioned. Going against my family automatically makes me feel like I am messing up. When I picked a college they didn't want me to go to and refused to acknowledge or pay for, my first thought was that I messed up. When I divorced my husband and left Utah and my family stopped speaking to me, I thought I messed up. It has taken years to overcome what I have been taught and I am not a confident person. I let my 12 year old join the football team this year and can't stop questioning that. Every decision I make is harder for me than it is for most people. I am sorry if anyone feels like I am being anything other than genuine.", "Before any of you start freaking out at me, I want to say that I fully support both women and men asking for consent before getting touchy or sexual with another person, and I would never in my life think about treating another person that way. Now that thats out of the way, the AITA moment.  \n\nI've been with my girlfriend for the last 8\\~ months.  In this time, we've slept together, been sexual together, and all that jazz.  We've hit a comfortable routine where on friday nights one of us would go to the others place and spend the weekend there.  Our usual routine on the first night is watching some shitty movie or tv show until we realize we don't actually care what we're watching and would much rather make out.  This goes on until one of us decides to start pawing at each others genitals like a cat pawing the bottom of the door while you're trying to use the bathroom.  Things lead into foreplay followed by the usual sex times.   This has been our almost weekly routine for a good 3 months now.  We've been comfortable with each other and very open about our sexual desires and what not.\n\nNow, on this last friday, I went over to her apartment.  We put on some stupid netflix documentary that I can't remember the name of, and about half way through we started tongue boxing.  I got into it, and decided to start touching her, resulting in me getting under her pants.  I do the business and make her feel good.  After this, we just sit there for a minute in the after glow, before she pulls away from me and goes kind of silent.  I try to talk to her because I can tell somethings suddenly upset her but have no idea what, she tries to tell me that nothings wrong.  I tell her that I know when shes upset and if she's not willing to talk with me about it then I should probably just go, so she breaks down and says this.\n\n\"I just feel like you kind of use me.  You never ask for my consent before touching me and it makes me feel like an object instead of a person.\"\n\nNow, of course I understand the sentiment.  I'm not always the most romantic of person, I try to make her feel good and give 110% to her, but I can see where shes coming from.  Still, I was \\[visibly confused\\] at this statement, and she must have noticed because she huffed and pulled away again and said that I never listen to her.\n\nI point out how we've been dating for months, and that neither of us has asked for consent to touch the other since we first started dating and were just starting to be sexual towards one another.  She gets mad at this and says how it isn't the same for a woman as it is a man.  I tell her how blatantly a double standard that is.  \n\nAt this point shes getting angry and borderline yelling at me about this, and says that I'm no longer allowed to touch her in any way unless I ask first and she gives me permission.\n\nI say that it makes no sense for us to be dating and in a romantic relationship if she expects me to walk on eggshells just to try and be intimate with her, and say that shes making me feel like I'm some kind of molester or sexual offender because I want to touch the woman I've been dating for 8 months.\n\n\"Well maybe you are!\" she says angrily.  At this point, I'm angry, annoyed, and absolutely fed up.  I just say that if thats the way things need to be with her then maybe we just should break up.  She throws a fit over this and starts insulting me, at which time I just leave and go home.\n\nNot five minutes after I walk in my door, shes texting me saying that shes sorry for insulting me and yelling at me, I think it over for a minute and decide that I'm done, text her back that we're through, and go to bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI woke up in the morning to almost 50 texts, most from her either being apologetic or angry, the rest being from friends of hers or her sister calling me an asshole because I \"broke up with the perfect woman because I wasn't allowed to grope her whenever I want.\"\n\nSo, Am I the asshole here?  I feel like I'm justified in my reaction and opinions regarding this, but at the same time feel like maybe theres some new wave promoting the virtue of consent that I've missed?  Am I the asshole for thinking that you shouldn't need to ask for consent to touch or feel your partner if you're in a romantic relationship?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd before you start yelling at me (even though I'm sure half of you have already started typing) I respect a persons right to say no.  If I touch my girlfriend, or any girl I'm with sexually/romantically for that matter, and they say they aren't interested or aren't in the mood, I'll stop, no question.  I just think requiring consent every time is insane and more damaging to the relationship than anything.  ", "I'm 29, my sister is 27.\n\nWe're polar opposites. I've always worked hard and taken risks to succeed. My sister has always slacked off and never put any real effort in to succeed. She tried attending college but spent all her free time partying/smoking pot/sleeping around and ended up failing half her courses in her first year and dropped out. \n\nRecently she decided she wants to go back to university to become a nurse. She currently works as a cashier at a supermarket so it would be a big step up career wise. Problem is my parents have lost most of their savings due to some very poor choices and can't afford to support her while she studies and help pay her tuition.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm currently working as an actuary and have plenty of disposable income. Naturally, my parents think I should support her and pay her tuition while she studies. They say she'll continue working part time and will pay what she can, but I'm basically expected to support her and pay her tuition, or let her stay at my house so she doesn't have to pay rent.\n\nI shut down the idea immediately. In my opinion, her current situation is entirely her own fault for not working hard when she was younger. My GF and I plan on getting married soon and I don't want to waste money on my sister's education.\n\nAs you can imagine I'm now seen as the greedy brother who won't help out family... Even though my sister has never done anything to help me.\n\nSo yeah, Am I really the asshole here?", "Edit/Update:\n\nThe moderators have been kind enough to let me update my post.\n\nI know many, many people have asked about the skillset I mentioned. I just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable with a quick search. I will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. It's just a niche product and not many people do it. The tools and techniques are unorthodox.\n\nI spent a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.\n\nI have talked to my younger kids and I explained to them that even if they aren't happy with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.\n\nThey agreed to extend the offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a salaried employee. But they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. I actually think this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. He is feeling some sort of way about working for his brothers, not with them.\n\nI reached out to a teacher in Alaska who I know casually. He might do me a favor and take on an apprentice. \n\nI need to scrounge up some money and see if I can send my son there. But again, it's Alaska and I'm not sure if my son will be receptive.\n\nI don't know what else I can offer at this point. My wife is disgusted that we've become that family that is fighting about money. She wants to force the twins to give a stake in the company to their brother but I really think it's a bad idea. They need to fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. I don't believe we should be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.\n\nI'll be meeting my son this Friday for dinner. I hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.\n\nI also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. They've always enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. It's not helping.\n\nThanks everyone.\n\n\nThis is the original story:\n\nThis has quite literally fractured my family.\n\nI have an older son from my first marriage who's now 24. I have two younger kids from my current marriage who are 21 year old twins.\n\nMy divorce occurred right after my son was born. \n\nOver the years, my visitation has been primarily summers and holidays since my ex-wife moved to a different state.\n\nI have a particular skillset I'm was very good at. And all three of my kids have expressed interest in it. Unfortunately, I have only been able to meaningfuly teach it to my younger kids.\n\nThis was because to make my visitation with my older son more memorable, I would do camping/vacations etc. I didn't have time to teach him properly.\n\nAlso, anything I did try to teach him was forgotten and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.\n\nThe major issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using this skill. I provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. This company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.\n\nMy older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly making a lot of money. Especially compared to his siblings.\n\nPart of this is my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe have me teach him what I knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and I told him I couldn't.\n\nAnd now, I'm not well enough to teach anymore.\n\nHe is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. That he'll do the finances.\n\nThis was not received well by his siblings who say they do basically 95% of the work. And that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to get it running.\n\nI'm really at a loss here. I thought of just giving my share of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started this company in the first place.\n\nMy oldest has become very bitter about this and has involved my parents. They are taking his side and now my younger kids are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.\n\nOur Sunday family lunches are no longer happening and I'm having to see my oldest for dinner on other days. And everytime I see him I'm getting accused of not treating him fairly. It kills me because I made so many compromises to have him in my life in a meaningful way.\n\nHe accused me on Saturday of pushing him out my new family and loving his siblings more. I haven't been able to sleep since.\n\nShould I have done all this differently?", "I was dining at an upscale restaurant and the bill came out to $49.82. I pulled out a $50 to pay, and told the waitress I didn't need change. Goes without saying, but I was planning on leaving the rest of her tip on the table. I used to work as a server. I always tip generously. \n\nThe waitress misunderstood my intentions and said \"Really?\" loud enough for all the other diners to hear. Before I could say anything, she said something like \"Woooow- thanks for the generous tip\", snatched the payment from the table, and walked away in a huff. All the diners around me were staring daggers at me. It was humiliating. \n\nI flagged down the manager and let him know what happened. He knows me and knows I'd never stiff servers. \n\nHe offered to comp the meal, but I said it wasn't necessary. I just wanted to let him know what happened and would be on my way. The manager insisted that I was owed an apology. Made sense to me at the time. She apologizes, gets her tip, I leave, everyone is happy. \n\nWhen the manager called the waitress over, both of us saw her roll her eyes as she was walking here. As soon as the manager saw this, he put on his \"you're about to get fired\" face. All the tears and pleading made no difference. It was ugly. People were filming with their cell phones. \n\nAs she was being escorted to the back by some kitchen workers (who probably think I'm the second coming of Satan). The manager insisted on comping our meal and we went on our way. \n\nWhen we got home, the wife claimed I was an asshole for making a huge scene out of nothing, and getting that poor girl fired over a simple misunderstanding. I feel like all I did was share a legitimate complaint to the manager. She is the one who escalated it by rolling her eyes at us. Am I being unreasonable? What would you have done in this situation? ", "Back in 2009 when the economy tanked I lost my job, my car, my apartment, my girlfriend. Basically everything. At first I didn\u2019t want anyone to know what had happened so I stayed at a friends house for a week while I looked for a new job. But his landlord told me guests couldn\u2019t stay for more than 7 days at a time in a 30 day period. So I asked my mother if I could stay with her while I looked for a job. I told her I\u2019d be on the street homeless if she didn\u2019t help me and she still decided to refuse to help me. Fast forward 2 months, I\u2019ve been sleeping on the streets for every night still unable to secure a job. Even something like Safeway or McDonald\u2019s. My dad finds out that I\u2019m homeless and sends me a ticket to come live with him in NJ and I accept. Within a week I have a job and in 3 months I\u2019m in my own place again. It\u2019s been 10 years since then and I haven\u2019t spoken to my mother because of what I perceive to be a betrayal. She attempts to contact me frequently and I ignore it. AITA for cutting her out of my life? \n\nTL;DR mother let me be homeless and I never forgive her.\n\nEdit: I have already cut ties. I haven\u2019t spoken to her in 10 years. It\u2019s my siblings telling me that I am the asshole that prompted this post.\n\nEdit: people keep asking for her reasoning and all I can say is what she said to me. She said she couldn\u2019t afford to let me stay. But all I was asking for was a place to sleep. Not money, or food. I was getting a small unemployment check and eventually I got food stamps. I could have contributed. \n\nEdit: I guess I also have to say that I never asked my parents for anything. I\u2019ve earned everything I have. I am not a drug user and I have never been. I don\u2019t drink and I\u2019ve been the most responsible of all the children. Oh and my post should probably be she let me STAY homeless instead of let me be homeless.", "I guess it should be are \u201cwe\u201d the assholes, but idk if that\u2019s an accepted acronym here. \n\nApologies that the line up is a bit complicated but I\u2019ll try to lay it out as best I can. \n\nMy family is going on a group vacation this summer. We are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. My husband and I are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization. \n\nIt will be me, my husband and our two kids, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (Kids\u2019 ages range from 3 to 9). In addition, my sister, her husband and their girlfriend are invited.\n\nWe initially only invited my sister and her husband,  but my sister insisted that their girlfriend (who I think they\u2019ve been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well. \n\nMy sister is in a polyamorous relationship and, although my family and I don\u2019t get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. So as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone  please refrain from any PDA in front of the kids. We were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. \nMy sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances. \n\nAt this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. I\u2019m conflicted though. She\u2019s my sister and I obviously love her. But I also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation. \n\nAre we wrong?", "Wife and I got married as widowers. My late wife and daughter passed away in an accident. My daughter was only 1 when she passed away. My current wife had 3 yo twins when we got married. The girls are 15 now.\n\nSo, yesterday when wife and I were watching a movie, she told me that the girls were planning a surprise for me on their birthday. And when I asked her what it was, she told me that they wanted me to adopt them. I was really happy, because it meant that I had done a good job, but unfortunately I cannot adopt them. I'm actually glad that my wife told me that. A surprise would have caught me off guard. \n\nThe thing is, my wife and I had discussed about this when they were young. I made it clear that I didn't want to adopt anyone or have more children. Call it coping up with my daughter's death or whatever, but I've never felt comfortable thinking about it. My wife is now asking me to say yes. \n\nI've been there for them and I'll always be there for them. I love them but I don't think I'll be comfortable adopting them. WIBTA here?", "Throwaway because I have to use my brother's laptop after the incident.\n\nI (18f) have just started university and after two years of saving up, I splurged on a \u00a32000 ($2600) HP Spectre with the highest specs. I treasured the laptop, it was my baby. I used it for all of my uni work, gaming, watching shows, everything really.\n\nNow, my step dad is a horrible person. He's always complaining about what I spend my money on and spent all of my time working trying to get me to quit so I wouldn't be able to spend so much money. He's always had it in for my laptop and my phone that I paid a lot for.\n\nI should also mention that I don't live with him, so what I spend my money on makes no difference to him.\n\nAnyway, I've just come home for easter break and my step dad has destroyed my laptop. I don't know how this happened exactly, but he sat on it, put it on the floor when he realised, and then stood on it when he got up. I could tell by the smug look on his face that he meant to do it and he wasn't remorseful in the slightest. When my mum was out of the room, he's made it clear I deserved it and hasn't stopped joking about it. He's also 'jokingly' said my phone is next.\n\nMy mum has forced him to apologise and she also made him agree to buy me a new one, as hes literally destroyed this one beyond repair. I'm already super upset about losing my games (but thankfully my work was backed up).\n\nHowever, he's saying he can't afford to replace the laptop over \u00a3500. I understand that \u00a32000 is a lot of money, but he broke it on purpose, and I spent so long saving. I've made it clear that if he doesn't replace it with the same specs and nothing less I will be either pawning his television, watch, old laptops, whatever or going to the police. My whole family thinks this is awful of me as this would be extremely hard for my family.\n\nSo, I know I'm not the asshole for the broken laptop. But am I for accepting nothing less as a replacement?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I just want to say thank you guys so much for all the well wishes and advice. Let me clear a few things up as well:\n\n\\- unfortunately, the laptop is snapped in half by my whale of a step parent, so there's no chance of repairs\n\n\\- also, I know I'm not TA for asking for the replacement, I just know how much my family will struggle to pay me back this amount and my main concern is whether I'm wrong to do that to the rest of them :(", "My daughter is 17 months old. Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.\n\nMy mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. To me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. Something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when I addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. So I told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. AITA?", "For context, I am really into body building and have been going to the gym 3-4 times a week since I was 13 (now 29).\n\nThere is a personal trainer, Ashley, at my current gym thats also a single mother of two. I mention this as it\u2019s the reason I think I\u2019m probably an asshole since she clearly needs the job to support her kids.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not really friends with her, but she\u2019s always really nice to me and has flirted with me a lot previously. We talk occasionally. Yesterday she asked if I wanted to add her on social media and I figured why not, so I said yes.\n\nLater in my workout I started looking through her posts out of boredom when I saw a picture of a morbidly obese person along with a caption making fun of them trying to run. The picture was clearly taken at the gym.\n\nThis really angered me because they\u2019re trying to improve their health, and the last thing they need is some attractive young girl talking shit about them, even if it\u2019s not to their face. I scrolled through a few more posts and sure enough this is a regular thing. She discreetly takes pictures of fat people to make fun of when they\u2019re working out.\n\nReally really pissed me off to see these people being made fun of for trying to fix their life. Without thinking I just went straight to the owners office (we know each other well) to show him. Ashley was fried immediately.\n\nWhen I told my GF she said I\u2019d let my anger get the best of me because now her kids will suffer if she can\u2019t find another good job. So now I feel kinda shit about doing that, AITA?", "Hi everyone.\n\nMy boyfriend broke up with me and told me its because I'm a horrible person for not accepting him. He's on reddit more than me (first time posting, hi) so he will definitely see this.\n\nTo keep the story very short: I met him a year ago - he was my first real boyfriend (I'm f/late 20s) and told me around our 5th date that he had recently started becoming a furry. Wasn't a dealbreaker for me and I really liked him, so we continued dating.\n\nHe started getting more deeply into it, bought two really scary fursuits for 5400\u20ac (glow-in-the-dark eyes, jesus), asked me to have sex in the suits. Again, I accepted. Personally, I'm not into this whole thing at all but he was and I liked him, so it was all okay on my front.\n\nAround our 6-month anniversary, he started to wear the fursuit pretty much all the time apart from work. That started annoying me because it was summer and super hot and more often than not I would end up having to sleep on the sofa because it got so hot in his bed. He got really upset about it and told me he needed me to buy a fursuit as well so we could be 'mates'. I declined (honestly, at that point it was mostly because I didn't have the money - I probably would have done it for him if he'd pestered my long enough).\n\nOur relationship got worse but then my friend from back home asked me and a whole bunch of friends to dinner since she'd recently had a baby. BF was obviously invited.\n\nHe wanted to go in the fursuit and I told him no. He told me I needed to accept him and not be ashamed of him and I told him that we had agreed he could do whatever he wanted in his or my apartment but not during meetings with my family and friends because most of them wouldn't get it and I especially didn't want to have to explain to my grannie and older relatives.\n\nHe accused me of not accepting him, of being an intolerant and racist 'cunt', for not accomodating him and getting a fursuit on my own etcetc. and then broke up with me. He's been guilt-tripping me on social media and amonst our friends ever since and has made me feel horrible bc of this. The first few months afterwards I was honestly really freaking broken up about it and it's only been recently that I've been getting angry instead.\n\nEDIT: I'm very overwhelmed by the responses, thank you to everyone who had something nice to say and made me feel better about the situation. Many of the comments gave me a lot to think about and I'm glad to know that people don't think I was acting horribly. Thanks again :)\n\nEDIT2: An acquaintence let me know that he read this and isn't happy. \n\n&#x200B;", "This past Friday, my girlfriend and I had a small get together at our apartment where I proceeded to get very drunk. I'm not a very experienced drinker. My girlfriend put me to bed early in the night. The next morning, I wake up very hungover and thirsty. I see that there is a water bottle on my night stand with a sticky note that says \"water\" on it. I thought this was weird at the time, because what else would it be? Very thankful that I didn't have to get up to get water, I proceed to chug the \"water\" only to quickly realize that it was actually vodka and then vomit all over our bed. At that point, my girlfriend woke up and was very angry at me. \n\nI felt very bad, I didn't realize at the time that my girlfriend had left the bottle there, so I got up and cleaned everything up even though I felt like dog shit. She denied putting the \"water\" there so I just thought one of our friends did it. It was a shitty thing to do, but I got over it until later that day one of the people there that night tagged me in an Instagram video of my girlfriend basically setting up the prank. It shows her pouring vodka into a water bottle and saying how funny it's going to be while her friend filming it is telling her she's being a dick and she just laughs and says \"hair of the dog\" then howls.\n\nI confronted my girlfriend about this and she thinks the video is hilarious and sees no problem with it. I told her if she really didn't remember doing this, then she has a drinking problem. It was a very cruel thing to do. She said I was overreacting and being sensitive.\n\nEdit: I really don't think she lied. I think she probably did it in a blackout.", "sister, teri\nsisters bf, tom\n\nso I'm most likely the asshole but here we go. \n\nso my sister started dating this guy 2 years ago, everything was fine until last week. \n\nnow a few dates in Tom tells her that he is a father to a boy and a girl and that he has custody of them every 3d weekend and whenever he wants during the holidays. \nteri was ok with this surprisingly as she is subbed to heaps of child free pages. \n\nlast week I found out that they wanted to move in together, he was looking for 2 bed places so the kids have a room.\nI thought that she would be fine with this, turns out she is not. \n\nshe complained to me a few days back that she hated that the kids had to tag along and that she hopes he looses custody of them so they can have more one on one time. I asked her if she was joking and she replied. no why would I want fucking crotch goblins living with me. I then repeated so it's a joke right? and she said no. \nso I asked her why she is moving in with someone who has kids, and her response was, he is hot. \n\nI told her that she should break up with him if she hates the kids so much as they are a package deal and she got mad at me and left. \n\nI then got a message where she sent me a photo of some weed and the caption, custody no more.

Instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) I decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  It was a blast.  We all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  I mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  But I specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  Well wouldn't you know it, Sams ticket won.  Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to claim it.  It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  They absolutely wanted a gaming system, and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  We all agreed on this, and saving the rest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a Disney World trip.  The boys don't even like Disney, but it was always Wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  Another $5k.  Last year, Sam wanted a car.  Wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so I agreed and spent \"his\" $4k on a car.  I pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving Scott to his stuff as well.  Wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince day 1, I've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  I've always spent my OWN money on all this stuff.  I have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  She knows I was investing the lottery winnings as well.  I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess I never explicitly said how well.  She also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  While looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  I told her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  She then asked why we're only giving Sam $30K when it should be $50k.  I said no, the other $40k is mine.  I managed this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work.  Plus I paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing it.  If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  She thinks I'm stealing \"his\" money since I wouldn't have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with.

He wore a tux for his best friend's wedding when he was 20 and that's the last time he's worn a tie.

I\u2019m 16 and have been told I have a baby face but I guess that\u2019s just how it is.\n\nThe condoms are locked behind a cabinet thing I guess because of theft or something idk but I asked a lady who was on shift, but wasn\u2019t doing anything if she could open it up. She made a comment \u201cAren\u2019t you a little young to be needing those young man\u201d which really caught me off guard and I sorta just stammered and studdered and kinda embarrassed myself and I just mumbled again that I needed them. \n\nShe basically made a condescending exaggerated \u201chmfph\u201d noise and said \u201cI outta really call your mama and tell her what you\u2019re doing instead of helping you act a fool; you know you don\u2019t need to be using these\u201d before moving towards the condoms. My mom and I go shopping here often so while I personally didn\u2019t know this lady, it\u2019s not unlikely that she has seen me walk in here with her\n\nHere\u2019s where IDK if I\u2019m TA because she WAS getting the condoms, but her threat pissed me off and she was being such a huge bitch the entire way that I basically aggressive said \u201cit\u2019s none of your business for why I need these, fuck off and do your job\u201d. She was taken aback at this point and people started to stare and she was like \u201cexcuse me?\u201d and I said \u201cyou heard what I said\u201d. \n\nShe said I\u2019m not going to be doing anything and I needed to watch my mouth and she\u2019s not going to get anything for anyone with that kind of attitude and that\u2019s when I got really mad because she was wasting my time and humiliating me in front of the entire store and so I said \u201cGive me a manager if you don\u2019t want to do your fucking job then\u201d and she stammered before refusing, so I ended up asking another employee. \n\nLong story short I ended up getting the condoms, but I\u2019m still so mad and upset that she essentially humiliated me in front of the entire store and my heart\u2019s been racing the entire day. Did I handle the situation badly? AITA?", "My birthday was this past Monday, and my parents got me a cake for it, naturally. I'm originally from Michigan but go to school in Texas, and as a surprise my parents mailed me something called a 'bumpy cake'. They were like my favorite thing when I was little and I'm not sure if they're ONLY available in Michigan but I definitely can't get them in Texas. \n\nMy boyfriend and I each had a slice of the cake, and then put it in the fridge. When I got back from work the next day I was super excited to eat more of it, only to find that not only was pretty much all of it gone, but it was butchered in a way that suggested it had just been eaten out of the box with a fork. \n\nI went into the bedroom where my boyfriend was and showed him the cake box. He laughed and said something along the lines of \"I couldn't help it!\" I called him a selfish asshole and told him I couldn't believe he felt so entitled to something that didn't belong to him. \n\nHe seemed really shocked and upset and said he didn't think it would be such a big deal. He started apologizing profusely and said he'd get me another cake but I was so upset with him I just left. I came back a little while later and he had gone from sympathetic to angry. He said he couldn't believe I was so mad at him over a \"stupid fucking cake\" and he ended up storming out. \n\nI realize it seems stupid and I might have overreacted, but I still think it was completely out of line for him to do that. I've told some friends about the situation and they similarly thought I was being ridiculous and that I shouldn't have been so mad over cake. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE: I've gotten a few messages asking for an update, so I figured I'd post one here. I haven't been able to read every comment, but I've looked at responses from every viewpoint and have taken everything to heart. A lot of you seem to think I'm just really stingy with my cake, but what I articulated to my boyfriend this morning was that I moreso was extremely upset that he felt entitled to what was essentially my birthday present. \n\nWhen he came back he had cooled down a lot, and we talked about everything. He apologized for eating all of the cake, and I apologized for losing my temper about it. When we argue we both have a habit of leaving instead of letting the argument escalate. I'm still not sure if this is the right move or not. \n\n  \n\nP.S - To all the people messaging me offering to send me a replacement, your generosity is very much appreciated, but a new cake has been ordered!", "I have a 16 year old son and he has 4 half siblings who are all younger than him. I was only ever with his mom for a brief period of time, and we both agreed prior to sleeping with each other that we were on the same page about not having a kid. \n\nObviously that didn\u2019t work out because she got pregnant (I did practice safe sex and wore rubbers but hey, I\u2019m a dad now anyway)I asked her to abort, she told me she\u2019d changed her mind, and she kept the baby.\n\nI wasn\u2019t thrilled about being a dad, after paternity was established I set about paying child support and that was it. I had no intention of wanting to be in his life especially because my own parents had kicked me out and I was still a kid myself.\n\nAfter a few months though I felt the need to be there and actually be a father, so I put aside my own feelings and put him first. we are incredibly close today and I\u2019m so glad and grateful that I got to be his dad.  I was 18 when I had him, and over the years I was lucky enough that I was able to become financially independent and in essence retire early so I\u2019m able to give my son experiences that I never had. \n\nHe chose to live with me when he was 11, which was a huge sore spot for his mom, but he\u2019d always beg prior to that because his brothers and sisters would break his stuff, and he\u2019d get yelled at because he\u2019s the oldest, etc. \n\nHis mom has always been courteous, but over the last few years she has become more and more resentful that my son gets more than her other kids. She is by no means poor, but obviously her resources are spread over 5 kids whereas mine is spread over 1. \n\nIt was his birthday last week and as a gift I bought him a car, which he\u2019ll be needing soon anyway and which I\u2019ve had the cash aside for for *years*. When his mom found out, she called me furiously on the phone and told me I that I\u2019m a piece of shit for making her other kids feel bad, because I\u2019ve \u2018never spent a penny on them and every time he goes to visit it\u2019s obvious his dad is spending money on him\u2019 ... I snapped back and told her that what, she expects me to shell out on kids I have no obligation to just so she doesn\u2019t feel bad? \n\nShe said that all the years of them seeing my son go on vacations, his clothes, his mannerisms (what?) etc made her and her kids feel bad, and she told me that I was selfish for having a fund for ONLY my son because none of her other kids will be able to afford college. I told her that\u2019s an unfortunate reality for kids who have different parents and it is what it is. \n\nShe\u2019s normally pretty level headed so I honestly have no idea why she thinks it\u2019s acceptable to ask me to pay for her other kids too- I\u2019ve never tried to flaunt anything via my kid, I just want him to have the best I can give him.", "I've been dating my girlfriend for almost three years now (M18) (F17). Since she's considered a minor medically she was put into a youth anorexia program for her eating disorder. Shes been doing really well, improving a ton and making much faster progress than anyone there, (she knows and wants to get better but is still really mentally fragile). A girl was admitted last week for severe eating disorder, I'm taking fights nurses, refuses to eat and threatens to harm herself if they make her eat. My girlfriend told me that the girls been anorexic since she was 9, she's 17 now and has made zero progress according to her parents (she overheard, they share a room).\n\nA few days ago my girlfriend mentioned that she's been trying to make friends with the new girl but she makes her severely uncomfortable. Basically telling her that she looks perfect the way she was and that gaining weight was going to make her unattractive to me. Shes also been telling her things like \"Why do you want to get better, you look so healthy\" and \"Wow your boyfriend must have loved your body, it's a shame\".\n\nI eventually mentioned to a nurse that my girlfriend should be moved out of that environment ASAP and was moved to a different room yesterday. A few hours ago I went to visit and the girl basically confronted me and told me that I was an asshole for taking away her friend. \n\nThings eventually escalated and I left off yelling at her to stay the fuck away from my girlfriend. \n\nAm I in the wrong? I don't know how anorexia effects people mentally and am not sure if she even realized what she was doing was wrong.\n\nEdit for clarity: My girlfriend told me she doesn't want to be around the girl, her intentions on being friends ended the second she started being toxic to her.", "The other day I was at a BBQ and was talking with everyone when a friend says to me \"I have a bone to pick with you\". I was a little shocked because I like to think I'm nice enough and get along with people, but I was keen to find out what her issue was with me.\n\n\n\"You don't say good-bye, you just leave\" is what she said, and it's true. I prefer to just leave a party and let everyone keep going. I do it because if I announce I am leaving then people often ask me to stay or ask why I'm leaving, sometimes it makes other people think \"yeah I might go too\" ending the party earlier. I prefer to just disappear. \n\n\nAnyway I explained myself to this friend and she said \"no it's super rude\". We're Australian so I told her to go fuck herself and we both laughed. After that BBQ I made a point of saying goodbye to her directly, but I still prefer to ghost. My wife isn't a fan of me doing this but she has long since accepted it.\n\n\ntl;dr - I like to leave parties without saying goodbye to most people (please read the edits, I do thank the host and I now know it's an Irish goodbye). Am I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit: I should note that I do try to tell the host I am leaving (if I can get them alone without causing a scene by saying good-bye) and if not I text them to say thanks. It's just everyone else I'm trying to avoid.\n\n\nEdit 2: she was not the host of this BBQ, it was my in-laws bbq and she was a neighbour that was invited. I ghosted that event late into the night because my house is a few hundred metres down the road and I was 15 shades of fucked up.\n\n\nEdit 3: fmd my inbox is nuked\n\n\nEdit 4: TIL that this is called an Irish goodbye.

He reeaallyyy, I can't stress this enough, does not want a baby. I honestly don't even think he'll show up for the birth or anything.\n\nShe has decided to continue with the pregnancy against all advice from practically every adult in her life. After she insisted on not only continuing with the pregnancy but raising the baby I asked her how she is going to manage that? This was the jist of the convo:\n\nHer: I'll get a job. \nMe: who's going to watch baby while you're at work? \nHer: I thought you and dad could.\nMe: absolutely not, I'm not raising another baby.\n\nPretty much a back and forth for a bit that lead me to believe that if she has this baby in this house, I'm practically going to be its mother. I'm very recently retired  and my husband is retiring in exactly 11 months (there's a countdown) and this is not how I want to spend my retirement years. It's not fair to us. So I told her that she has until baby is born to find a place to live. Husband has always been wrapped around her finger (which normally is endearing, I love how much he loves our children) so he is not fully on board with that but I feel like we need to be united on this. I just want to know if  I'm in the wrong here.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: to everyone acting like I'm spending the next 7 months ignoring her- I will help her get a job, get on assistance if need be, find affordable housing etc. I just will not raise this baby.", "\nMy parents split up when I was about 7 years old because my dad had an affair and got another woman pregnant. My mom got full custody and my dad eventually stopped visiting my sister and I and stopped paying child support. He justified this as him not having enough money for us and his new family, but either way I had no contact with my dad for around 15 years. About a month ago, he tried to get back into contact with me and apologize for his actions in the past. However, today he asked if my sister and I could get tested as a match because he has kidney failure (which I had no idea about until now) and a possible donor. I rejected his request and told him I wasn\u2019t ready (or might never be ready) to forgive him for abandoning me and my sister until now and I suspect he only contacted us in order to get a donation out of us. After rejecting him, he sent a bunch of angry texts about how he would die without a donation from us and basically said I was murdering him. Some of my friends also said I should forgive him because he is my father and that I am the asshole for potentially letting him die without the kidney. So AITA?\n\nEdit: His other kids are still pretty young (~15 and I\u2019m not sure how many other kids he has but I think at least one other) so I\u2019m not sure they are able to donate at their age. Also an update: my aunt (my dad\u2019s sister) who I also haven\u2019t spoken to since my dad left, just messaged me begging me to consider the donation. At this point I\u2019m leaning towards blocking the whole family and just never looking back.\n\nEdit2: Thank you for all your replies and advice. I\u2019ve decided to block my father and his side of the family and so has my sister.

She is a vegan and ordered a vegan dish. I ordered something that contained beef. \n\nWhen my dish came, my friend was shocked to see that it contained meat because she assumed that it didn\u2019t (for some reason). She said she no longer felt comfortable eating at the same table as me unless I sent the food back. I said no way I was going to do that.\n\nShe said \u201cmaybe we can reschedule\u201d and that she was sorry but she could not eat with someone who was eating meat.\n\nI said ok maybe we can get our food packed up. We did and then she said she wasnt feeling good and had to go back to her hotel. So I just sat on a bench in the park and ate my food by myself. It was really weird. \n\nShould I have been more accommodating? She isn\u2019t allergic to anything, apparently the smell of meat makes her sick? Which I just found out today. AITA.", "My husband and I have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?", "Throwaway because she knows my reddit account. Hear me out on this one. Please? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been with my girlfriend (we'll call her Molly) for about 4 years, lived together for 3. Earlier last year our 17 year old cat lost her battle with cancer. I've had cats my whole life and adopted her as a senior before meeting Molly. Molly never had cats before but adored her, and started talking about adopting immediately. About six months later in December she found a youngish (7mos?) feral male who got a nasty-but-recoverable injury sleeping under a car hood. She fell in love immediately and so did I. I tried to give her the benefit of my experience and told her that this isn't going to be the same as adopting an adult cat who already has a sweet personality, and this kitten will require a lot of patience. She said she understood and we started foster-to-adopting him as soon as the vet gave us the go-ahead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still love him, but he's highlighted every single thing that's been keeping us from getting engaged. For one, Molly refuses to listen to him. He growls, he hisses at her. She started yanking him out of his carrier so often that he's afraid to go in there now. She doesn't listen to ME when I try to explain what she could do to get him to warm up to her. She keeps bringing up examples of people she knows who got a cat to like them this way. I work at home, and he's a completely different cat when I'm home and she isn't.  He plays and sits in the window when it's just me and runs under the bed the second she gets home and only comes out to eat. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've suggested to her that we need to start seriously thinking about finding him another home before he gets too old and too scared. Every single time I bring it up she accuses me of being callous and giving up on him too easily, and how she never knew pets were so disposable to me. They're not, but she's not a good fit for him. So at this point I'm beginning to think that his best shot is me breaking up with her and taking this poor cat with me.  Our relationship isn't that solid but I think it might be fixable if it wasn't for this, but he's a living being and deserves to be happy too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: My girlfriend and I adopted a cat and she makes him miserable. She thinks it'd be cruel to rehome him, so I'm seriously considering breaking up with her and taking him with me. WIBTA?", "I'm a 28 y/o male and my immediate family is all women, mostly this is because I was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when I was young. My two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. \n\n\nAbout 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. Originally this was to see one of the Magic Mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. Originally it didn't bother me, because I'm an adult and I have my own life, and my own house, and I really didn't even think about it. But an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. My aunt's birthday was in January and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. So I bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. \n\n\nWhen I asked what was going on for her birthday, I was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. This kind of irked me because when I mentioned I bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. I felt pretty left out since I am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. \n\n\nI griped about and was told that I was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. I agree with that, but once again, I'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was I was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when I asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. \n\nAt this point I was VERY annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. Nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so I decided I needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. So I removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my Facebook. Now my phone is being blown up and I'm being told that I'm immature and I need to grow up. I responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and I'm just going to follow that example. \n\n\nAm I the asshole here? ", "So I lent a friend of mine \u00a3500.

I sent him a message about it. He said \u201coh yeah, sorry I forgot, I\u2019ll do that now\u201d \n\nTwo weeks pass and still nothing. I message him again. He said he\u2019d send me the money. Still nothing. He was then avoiding me so I wasn\u2019t able to see him face to face. \n\nI messaged him again and he didn\u2019t reply.\n\n7 months have passed since the day he promised to have the money back to me by. I\u2019ve not been able to get hold of him, nor have I seen him. \n\nThis weekend just gone, I was out at a restaurant and I happened to see him as I was being seated at my table. He was on what looked like a date. \n\nNow at this point I could see he was acting kinda boasy because he had ordered about 5 starters. It\u2019s worth noting that this is a pretty pricey restaurant. So I decided I\u2019d go and say hello. \n\nI pulled up a chair at his table and started chatting to him about how he is and how I am etc. \n\nI then proceeded to pick up a fork and try a bit of the food. He looked a bit shocked, but it was good food so I tried something from one of the other plates. At this point his date (I\u2019d learnt that this was their second date) said to me, \u201cexcuse me, but this is our food. What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d \n\nI looked at her and said \u201cWell since I\u2019m pretty much funding this meal, I figured I may as well sample what my money is getting.\u201d \n\nI then said to my friend, \u201cit was nice to see you, I\u2019ll leave you to it. We can catch up another day.\u201d\n\nI then left to go back to my table. The people I were with, a party of 10, had very mixed reactions to my behaviour.

So the next day his friend shows up while I\u2019m at work. When I get home I greet the friend (who I\u2019ve never met before). I then proceed to go to the bedroom where I change out of my work clothes and throw on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts with no bra. I never wear a bra at home as I find them immensely uncomfortable and hate them with a burning passion. I then go out to the living room to join them. As I\u2019m sitting down the friend makes a comment, something along the lines of \u201cdude, put on a bra\u201d. I figure he\u2019s joking since he kinda laughed before he said it so I just brush it off. He doesn\u2019t bring it up again for the rest of that visit. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and my bf wants to have his friend over again. So his friend comes over and this time I\u2019m home when he gets dropped off.  I was not wearing a bra when he arrived. I would like to point out that I was wearing a rather baggy T-shirt so it wasn\u2019t as if you could really see anything. That being said I do have enormous titties (I wear a size 40I bra). Immediately after walking in the door the friend says in an exasperated tone \u201cI thought I asked you last time to please wear a bra!!\u201d  I\u2019m taken aback and I don\u2019t really know what to say. I kind of stammer our a \u201cwhat,why?\u201d \n\nHim: I feel really uncomfortable seeing your boobs \nMe: But you can\u2019t actually see my boobs \nHim: Are you kidding me? They\u2019re huge! Of course I can see them! \nMe: Dude, I\u2019m wearing a baggy shirt. At most you can see a bit of an outline. I don\u2019t understand what about that makes you uncomfortable. \nHim: you\u2019re joking right??\nMe: No...? \nHim: fucking unbelievable\n\nI look to my bf for help and he  kinda just shrugs at me. So I excuse myself to the bedroom. A little while later my bf comes into the bedroom to see if I\u2019m ok. I tell him I\u2019m fine, just a bit taken aback. He asks if I wanna come play video games with them in the living room and I agree. Before we\u2019re out of the bedroom though he turns around and tells me that maybe I should put on a bra.  I had explained to him before how I felt about bras. He said he understood but didn\u2019t want to make his friend uncomfortable. I was annoyed and told him I would just stay in the bedroom. So for the rest of his friend\u2019s stay I stayed in the bedroom and only went out to go to the bathroom, get food, or go to work. \n\nSo finally his friend leaves and everything is back to normal. Then last night out of nowhere my bf brings up the bra thing again. He tells me I should\u2019ve just sucked it up and put on a bra and that I was kind of being an asshole about it. I feel like I should be allowed to not wear a bra in my home but also I wonder if I should\u2019ve been more accommodating to a guest that\u2019s very important to my bf. \nSo, am I the asshole here?", "Pretty short one, I live in the US and got married (hitched) a few months back after a long relationship (3 years).

That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.\n\nI dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money?\n\n\\*\\*Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends.\n\n\\*\\*Edit 2 Theres so many comments and I am trying to read them all. I do respect her. I do love her for more then her beauty. Shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. She's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. Honestly I am blown away with how pretty she is and I've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. So that part does excite me.\n\nI genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.\n\nI shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Final Edit\n\nAt this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.\n\nI was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. I didn't want to be the guy everyone said I was. I really didn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst I want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. Yes I knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. We have been dating for around 3-4 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext I want to say She was meeting some of my good friends. I was not trying to \"show her off\" in that she was a trophy for me. I was trying to point out her accomplishments. I thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. I can see where I was wrong. I did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and I felt it was more glamorous. I am an asshole for that. I did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and I'm also the asshole for that too. I wont deny it. But I DONT just see her as a trophy. I do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because I learned something really really important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter this thread blew up like it did and I had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick I was I knew I was dead wrong and had fucked up. I texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. I asked her if we could talk about it and I could try and make it up to her. She agreed. I told her I wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if I could sit in on some of her classes. She said she would like that. I made it top priority. I left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I saw really opened my eyes to be honest. I watched two classes and took part in the second one. The first one was her with a kids after school class. She was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. Someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. Thats dead wrong. It must be much harder to teach kids and I think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. I saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she DOES want to be a mom one day).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second class was a womens self defense class. I took part in this one as \"the bad guy\" and I was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. I got manhandled by about 15 women. We had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. For those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. She taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. Most importantly I saw the qualities beyond her appearance that I love most about her really shine. I realized the things I love most about her; Her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. This is really the part of her I love. It doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. I also saw how much she loved what she was doing. I saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. I'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong I was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her this when I went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. She also filled me on the modeling thing. She doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off its not as glamours as I thought it was\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe works as a model because of a few accidents. She was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. Thats all it took for her to be a model. It took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. She started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. She feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. She said being called a \"Model\" defines her by her appearance defines her by WHAT she is and not WHO she is. She doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. She doesn't feel that being a \"model\" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. That she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. She doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. She feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. She wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where I lit up and felt I had something to really offer her. I work in finance. Go ahead hate me but I DO like money. I like to have it, I like to make it, I like the freedom it affords and I like to watch it flow and grow. So I offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. I thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what I know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. We both win. She agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and I will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally I asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. I learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. In the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why I love her. So honestly thank you AITA yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but I needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. Is she the better person? Yes she is. Do I deserve her. No I dont, But I am going to do better. I really do love this woman, I wont ever do this again.", "My sister is having a Destination wedding in the Dominican Republic (all-inclusive).  It'll cost me $2800 dollars to attend (there's no option to adjust the dates/costs. it's for a full week).\nMy sister would be very upset if I don't attend.  My parents say I should go, and that I'm being selfish for saying I'm not going.  \n\nMy sister lives far away and we see eachother once a year due to cost/ busy schedules.   I don't make a ton of money, but I have enough money to attend the wedding and my parents and my sister know it.  While I really want to support her --and would attend a local/ more reasonabley priced destination wedding in a heartbeat-- $2800  just seems too much. And less importantly, I have zero desire to go to an all-inclusive resort as I don't drink or enjoy suntanning.\n\n  In my defence, I've worked hard for my money and I sacrificed quite a lot to be where I am financially.  And while I have accumulated significant savings, it isn't because I earn a big salary. But, because I work long hours, and very rarely spend money on anything beyond the bare essentials.  The cost of this trip would exceed the value of my worldly possessions including my car.  It would also require me using a full week of what little time I get off work.\n\n I really don't know if I'm being selfish, cheap, and callous or if I'm being reasonable.   Last night I almost booked the ticket out of guilt, but, I couldn't do it and have since resolved not to go.  So what do you guys think?  AITA not wanting to attend?", "I guess it goes without saying that I am proposing, but I should mention my girlfriend doesn't know I will be. I picked out a ring I think she'll like. She never wears rings and isn't a massive fan of diamonds. So I found a really nice gold one with an emerald that's surrounding by small diamonds. She loves green and gold jewellery, and I spent a long time finding this one. It's a created emerald which I think she'll prefer because she definitely wouldn't want any sort of conflict jewels. \n\nThe ring is cheap. It was \u00a3300 and has actually gone down to \u00a3180. I mentioned this to my sister who said I was a dick, essentially. Apparently, she'll be showing it to her friends (some of whom are engaged), who will know about rings and clarity and such. She says they will see that it's cheap and it will be embarrassing for her. I'm 90% sure my girlfriend doesn't know much about jewellery and clarity.\n\nI could probably get a similar ring that's more expensive. I certainly wouldn't know why I'm paying more, I don't think she would either. However, I am starting a new job soon and was going to buy a new TV for \u00a3250. I kind of realised I'm willing to spend more on myself for a random treat yourself present than an engagement ring and I started understanding my sister's perspective a bit more. So WIBTA?\n\nEdit: I just want to clarify that we have talked about marriage and are both on board. It's the proposal in terms of when and how I do it that would be a surprise.\n\nEdit 2: I really want to thank everyone for contributing and helping me out. I left to run some errands and returned to an overwhelming response full of additional advice which goes above and beyond, I really appreciate it. I am not going to be able to reply to everyone, but I am reading and upvoting.\n\nEdit 3: Thank you for the gold. I haven't found the comment it's on yet. I'm still trying to work through the comments!", "I moved into a new apartment building about a month ago. It's a doorman building and most of the doormen are really nice. I always say a pleasant, \"Hi, how are you? Have a nice day/evening\" to them when I leave or enter the building, but I don't stop to chat to them as I have seen some of the other residents do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the doormen (whose shifts coincide with my coming home from work) has this habit of trying to strike up a conversation with me as I'm almost out of the lobby and heading down the hallway to the elevator - like, he'll shout out a question to me, or comment about the weather or something. I usually (pleasantly) shout back an answer and keep walking to the elevator, as I'm always exhausted after work and just want to go to my apartment and relax.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other day he shouted out to me, \"Come here, Miss Pretentious,\" so this time I turned around and walked over to the front desk and said politely, \"What did you call me?\" He then proceeds to say I'm pretentious and obviously think I'm better than everyone else in the building because I won't stop to talk to him or the other doormen. His tone wasn't angry or mean really, just kind of jokey but in a condescending way. I politely explained that it's not that I think I'm better than everyone but that I'm just really tired after work and want to go home. I also said I find it weird that he always tries to talk to me as I'm almost out of the lobby, thereby necessitating me turning around and walking back into the lobby in order to have a conversation (if I wanted to). He ended by saying that I won't fit in with the \"culture of the building\" if I keep on refusing to talk with the doormen. I told him (again, politely) that I wasn't really interested in fitting in with the culture of the building and told him to have a good night and I then walked away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then I have seen this doorman twice and both times he has greeted me with, \"Hello, Miss Pretentious\" (same jokey, condescending tone) as I walk into the building. I have completely ignored him both times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I should probably talk to him and tell him I don't appreciate being called that, but honestly I just want to report him to his supervisor as I'm getting sick of dreading walking into the building and I feel like I shouldn't have to deal with that in my own home (ok, building). So WIBTA if I just go ahead and report him? I don't want to get him fired or anything, but I do want him to stop.", "This happened a few days ago and my girlfriend thought I was a bit rude, but I thought I was completely justified.\n\n\nSo we booked tickets for an almost full flight and the only row with 2 seats near each other had someone that already booked the seat in the middle. I figured they did this because they didn't want anyone booking next to them, but they were the only seats left so I booked the window for myself and the aisle seat for my girlfriend. \n\n\nWhen we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he\u2019s very proud of it. Then he asked if I could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. I was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. I honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. So we denied him, and he just comes at us with, \"you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?\" I answered, \"no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.\"\n\n\nAs I said my girlfriend said I was a little harsh and we could have switched seats, yeah it would have been nice to sit next to my girlfriend, but at the time she didn't want to sit next to me either. \n\n\nSo AITA here?", "I\u2019m posting this from my wife\u2019s account and both perspectives are included. I, the husband, am asking if I\u2019m the asshole. \n\nThis is a topic we\u2019ve been debating for the past almost two years now. It\u2019d be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. \n\nMy perspective (husband):\n\nMy wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. \n\nAfter eating something delicious, I can\u2019t quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I\u2019m talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. \n\nOver the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn\u2019t want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. \n\nOnce they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife\u2019s contractions started to pick up. \n\nAm I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?\n\nWife\u2019s perspective:\n\nMy husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he\u2019d complain I\u2019d say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. \n\nSo as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn\u2019t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. \n\nI did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. \n\nI\u2019d like to also mention it wasn\u2019t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. \n\nHe is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?", "I come from a fairly well off family, and my husband and I do well  (although we both work high demand jobs for it). We\u2019ve always been very generous to his side of the family. Gifts are very much both my husband and my \u201clove language\u201d and in my culture (Chinese), elaborate gifts to inlaws are very socially acceptable as a way to show they are held in high esteem. It also helps with some of our guilt for being super busy and not always around. Additionally, my side of the family exchanges generous gifts. One concern of mine originally was to treat my husband\u2019s family the same as my family, i.e. by not spending way more on my family than his.\n\nLast Christmas, we had some weirdness over Christmas day present opening. I had purchased a lovely cashmere throw for SIL (husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife). She googled the brand and price then and there (which kind of annoyed me) and later I overheard her make some joke about how she could pay \u201chalf a mortgage payment.\u201d  Several hours later during brunch, someone asked her what was wrong (she seemed upset) and she confessed that our presents always make her feel bad, she\u2019s tired of us \u201cthrowing our money\u201d in her and her husband\u2019s face, and Christmas has become really stressful with pressure over gift giving. Husband and I apologized profusely, and did some self reflection afterwards on the unintentional effects of elaborate gift giving and decided to go more low key in the future. Although a little part of it has always sat poorly with me since. \n\nThis past Saturday, I attended a baby shower for the same SIL. It\u2019s the first gift giving occasion since Christmas and I really wanted to do it carefully. I asked a coworker who recently had a baby what range is typically appropriate (she said she mostly got gifts between $30-$50) and so I decided on three little things from the registry totaling just over $30. Anyways, at the shower it becomes clear that while certainly most gifts were in the $30-50 range, all attendees who were family members seemed to give more like $100 gifts. Near the end of the event, MIL pulled me aside and said that SIL felt like I was being spiteful to her for  Christmas. I again apologized and as a cover, said that husband and I had written a check for the little one\u2019s college fund as well but didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate to hand to her during the present opening. Then I scurried off to the bathroom and wrote a check for $100. When I found SIL by herself for a second I handed her the check and explained that we wanted to give her this earlier but present opening seemed like a bad time. She looked at the check and kind of bitchily said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need your money.\u201d\n\nI kind of snapped and told her bluntly (and not like yelling, but not like in hushed tones either - people nearby apparently definitely overheard) that her that I was tired of her shit and if it made her feel better, we could just stop exchanging presents in the future. She started crying and I immediately left. I\u2019ve been getting my texts from everyone in the family and her best friend about how I ruined the baby shower ever since.\n\n(ETA for additional  context - My husband and his family are American and we live in the US. We are in our early/mid 30s, my BIL is 28 and SIL is 24 or 25.)\n\n(ETA2 - I realized her comment might have made the xmas gift sound way more than it was. The throw was 320 pounds, which isn\u2019t quite half a mortgage payment, but not cheap either. I purchased it for her during an business trip to Scotland last year. It is not fancy looking or flashy at all (light grey)  and not a obvious \u201c designer\u201d brand, just an old Scottish maker. It was intended to be good quality and last many years. If she hadn\u2019t looked it up I don\u2019t think it would have been an obviously expensive gift.)", "Throwaway because all parties know my account name.\n\nBackstory: My boyfriend (Alex\\*) and I have been together for 4 years, I\u2019ve become friends with his two best friends (James\\* and Noah\\*) but we\u2019re not particularly close nor do we ever hang out without him. I work for an airline and one of the major perks is that I get discounts on flights that I can also use for family and friends. As I am in my first year with the company I only get a certain number of discount seats and I had 3 left for the year.\n\nSituation: Alex asked me if I could use my discount to buy tickets for him and his two best friends. I happily agreed since he deserved a nice holiday. He booked his time off work and they made their plans. They were to send me the money and then I would put it all on my card just for simplicity.\n\nThree nights ago Alex came home really upset. He told me his friends had decided to change the holiday dates, bringing them forward a week, because it clashed with a concert they wanted to go to. He was upset because he couldn\u2019t move his holiday dates with work and when he told his friends they had decided to go without him because they had been looking forward to the gig for ages. I was pretty angry on his behalf especially since he had done most of the planning, including finding the hotel. To make up for I started planning a trip for me and him on his holiday dates.\n\nJames messaged me last night and said he would put the money in my account this morning. No ask if he could still use my discount, no explanation for what they had done, nothing. I was outraged that he would even suggest using my discount after fucking over my boyfriend. I sent him a polite but blunt message explaining that he and Noah were no longer able to use my discount on this holiday as I would be using the seats for me and Alex and that they were still welcome to use them on a holiday that involved my boyfriend in the future. He replied with a barrage of texts saying that I was being selfish and unfair as I had \u201cpromised\u201d two seats to him and Noah and that they were using the money they were saving to go to the concert. He even phoned Alex to complain. Alex is torn. He thinks it\u2019s a little unfair to let his friends down and doesn\u2019t want this affecting the relationship between me and his friends so I should just give them the seats to keep the peace. I refused and was hurt that he was still taking sticking up for them.\n\nAm I the asshole for going back on my word and choosing to use the seats for myself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone for your support. I must admit I know this seems a bit like a validation post with all the NTA votes but I hate going back on my word and I guess I did feel a bit like an asshole just because I've known these guys 4 years and didn't want to make life hard for my boyfriend so I needed some honest opinions. This sub has shown me the light and I will be showing Alex this when I get home. He is a massive people pleaser and hates letting people down so that explains it but he's going to get a spine even if I have to grow it in a lab. I'm standing my ground and taking the trip myself. Any holiday suggestions?\n\n2ND UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your votes and insights. It made me realise that even though most of you have voted me NTA, there are some things I hadn\u2019t considered. I have spoken to Alex and shown him this thread (guess I don\u2019t know why I used a throwaway) and he actually feels a lot better about speaking to them about it now. He apologised for making me feel bad for standing up for him when he didn\u2019t stand up for himself and I apologised for not discussing my choice with him before I told his friends they can\u2019t use my discount in the way that I did. He said he\u2019s just going to let it play out but he\u2019ll be willing to forgive them eventually. So for those wanting a final dramatic update, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be getting one. \nFor anyone asking or not believing the story because of this: I don\u2019t know the story of the concert, this is the story as I know it from my point of view. They\u2019re going to see SKEPTA.", "Throwaway. My girlfriend and I are in a huge/ potentially relationship ending argument. I need to know if ITA. \n\nI\u2019m in a very LDR with basically the girl of my dreams. Absolutely beautiful, smart, driven. Things have been great despite being a several hour plane ride away from each other. \n\nShe came to town, and I was so pumped to introduce her to my friends. They threw a party, and while on the way, GF randomly asked \u201care there any girls I should be worried about\u201d This is probably where I fucked up,  but I explained that a girl I used to see will likely be there. Explained that we were supportive of each other during our respective divorces, and we hadn\u2019t seen each other since well before I met GF. I was asked if we ever slept together. I said yes, because...we had. Also important to say that we never told out mutual friends about our fling, it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \n\nEverything started out great. Everyone was so welcoming to gf, including ex who was there with a new guy. \n\nGF gets drunk and made a comment about single moms dating being weird, almost directly after ex mentioned  her children. She randomly asked why she divorced ex husband...in front of everyone, and then asked, again in front of everyone, where we had gone on dates. I was honestly so surprised. So was everyone else. \n\nI apologized to ex and her guy as they were leaving, and she said \u201cno worries. Play 23 year old games, win 23 year old prizes\u201d (were all in our 30s) and gf heard this and sobbed in the bathroom for the rest of the night. She was so devastated that I didn\u2019t tell her that was out of line; however, I feel like nearly everything gf said to her was out of line. \n\nWe got into the biggest argument about how I didn\u2019t have the decency to stand up for her. I told her honestly, I should have stood up for ex when gf relentlessly tried to embarrass her, and she can\u2019t be surprised at a little passive aggressiveness after the way she acted. \n\nShe\u2019s now back on a plane, and we will \u201cdiscuss further\u201d once she clears her head.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit for clarification: friends are all in our 30s, girlfriend is 23. \n\nEdit 2: update: I\u2019ve gotten a ton of requests for an update, so here it is. I admitted that I\u2019m an asshole for how I\u2019ve gone about things, and how uncomfortable she must have been. I adore her, but I\u2019m not comfortable with the default response being \u201cI\u2019m jealous, I\u2019m going to be rude to someone I don\u2019t know\u201d \n\nShe is embarrassed and feels that those friends will always \u201cchoose\u201d the other girl. I tried to explain that they would never choose, that they do love other girl (in their wedding, kid was a flower girl, etc) and that I can\u2019t do anything about that, but I do know that every person there has embarrassed themselves drunk in front of each other. Every one of them, and I definitely think she can recover. But she doubled down on the jealousy a bit, and the situation made us both realize that we glorify each other from a distance, and that it\u2019s probably not going to developed past this. \n\nFor the record, neither me or the other girl have feelings for each other that aren\u2019t strictly platonic. Yes, I understand her comment was towards me. Plus, her new guy is a great guy, and really tried to make her (and everyone else) comfortable in an uncomfortable situation, guess I should take a page out of his book. ", "Going to try to make this quick. I'm 22 and my sister is 18. I went to my sister's room to grab a top she had borrowed(we do this all the time, borrow clothes go into each other's rooms to get them back) and I notice she has Facebook open and the profile pic is...well..me. I have to do a double take because it really caught me off guard. I know I shouldn't have but I snooped at the profile and it was just pictures of myself- my sister literally has a fake Facebook profile of me.\n\nI'm livid at this point for many reasons. 1. I don't do social media. I'm a private person and I don't like pictures of me to be on profiles like that. 2. Some of the pictures she had were ones that she took without me knowing 3. Other pictures that she had were ones I had sent to friends which means she has gone onto my computer and taken pictures off.\n\nI delete all of the pictures and I check her computer and find a folder filled with pictures that she has taken of me and ones that were on my computer- not even all of me per se, ones of my friends, group photos, food I had taken pictures of. I go through even more and find out that she has even stolen nudes that I had taken for my boyfriend.\n\nI deleted the folder completely and went back to the fake facebook profile. I uploaded a single picture of her with the caption \"The real me\", changed her name(she was using my middle name and a fake last name) and then left her room. I've heard her sobbing from her room all day but I'm too angry and embarrassed to even confront her right now. AITA for messing with the profile and not just confronting her in the beginning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I decided to confront my sister since I couldn't stand sitting around with a knot in my stomach. As soon as she saw me she started crying and begging me not to tell our parents and saying she was sorry. I told her that I don't think I could ever forgive her and that it made me sick to even look at her. I asked her why she had the fake profile. Apparently she met a guy 1 or  2 years ago on another site and she was too nervous to give him a picture of herself so she sent one of me. He really liked the picture and from then on it just snowballed. She got deeper into it, made the profile and said that she enjoyed all the attention it got her. I brought up the nudes and she played dumb at first, and then said that she must've accidentally copied them over too. I told her that I didn't believe her but she's sticking with that. I asked her to delete the facebook and got the e-mail and information attached to it so that I can change it and make sure she doesn't try to reactivate it. She tried to make me feel bad and tell me that she was gonna lose a lot of her friends because of this and how that was the reason she did it in the first place. At that point I just felt like she only felt bad she was caught and didn't really care about my feelings. I told her that she was being selfish for only thinking about how this hurt her but never thought about how her lies hurt me. She got upset again and I left shortly after. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw people mentioning that I should change my password on my computer- I've done that. I've explained the situation to my boyfriend and he offered to let me move in with him which I'm probably going to take him up on. I can't be in the house anymore- I feel so uncomfortable and I feel so paranoid about running into people that she may have talked to or sent pictures to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for people that have sent kind words/messages/advice. I really appreciate it. Today has been the worst day of my life, hands down. The relationship with my sister will never be the same and I don't think the uneasiness will ever go away.", "My daughter is 8, and has developed a bad habit of scaring and disturbing animals for fun.\n\n\nShe would jump from behind with a stomp and a \"WA!\" to any animals minding their own business, be it birds, stray cats and dogs and even butterflies and give them a fright, usually resulting them to either run or fly away. \n\n\nWe tried talking and scolding her, but she just brushed them off. She thought it was okay as long as she doesn't physically harm them.\n\n\nSo a while earlier she was on the sofa playing Nintendo switch, looking very focused, and I decided to let her have a taste of her own medicine.\n\n\nI approached her from the back quietly before snatching the controller from above(in case she dropped it) with a stomp and a \"WA!\". She was dazed for a moment before bursting into tears. \n\n\nMy wife called me a childish AH for scaring her like that, but I meant it as a lesson for her to know how animals feel like when she scared them since words could not get to her. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: I did talked to her and explain why I did it after she calmed down but my wife got in the way and insisted I apologise and make it up for her. I don't think that's appropriate since that defeats the purpose of teaching her a lesson, so I ended up posting on reddit to see if I am really in the wrong.\n\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the comments, I shall leave a little update here. I am glad that most people here agrees with me to the point of becoming Validation Post. The silly thing is that that this same post sparked another argument between me and my wife and our daugher was the one who made us cut it out, talk about being mature adults!", "My ex an I have an incredibly long history. We met when I was 18 and he was 19. He was my first love and we dated about a year. But after the break up we continued an off and on again friends with benefits relationship until I turned 23. Which was also the same time I found out I was pregnant...\n\nHe was going to school to be a doctor and he was in his second year of getting his doctorates when I found out. He also was studying in another state that was on the other side of the country. I got pregnant during one of his visits back home. \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant I told him immediately. He was very very angry and asked what I was going to do about it. I told him I\u2019d be keeping it and he told me he wanted no part in the child\u2019s life because it was going to ruin everything for him. I told him that wasn\u2019t an option. \n\nI myself grew up with my birth father jumping in and out of the picture and it\u2019s a big stem of my mental illnesses now. All things he knew.\n\nAfter begging him to be in the baby\u2019s life throughout almost my entire pregnancy one day he and his parents called me and offered me a deal. They offered to pay me a very hefty child support until the day the child turned 18 if I never forced him to be a real father. His parents (who are very wealthy) promised to take care of everything.\n\nAt first I said no. I refused and called them all assholes and told them my baby was gonna have a dad... but after talking to many of my friends and family they thought it best I take the offer. They told me there was no use in forcing him to be a shitty dad to my baby. I finally agreed about 8 months into my pregnancy.\n\nI took sole custody of course. It\u2019s been 7 years and I had a beautiful baby girl that I love more than anything on earth. Every single month I get a check and not once has it ever been late. I haven\u2019t seen or talked to my ex since the day he handed me the first check. Until about a week ago. \n\nI get a call and it\u2019s my ex. He tells me he wants to take joint custody of our daughter. The daughter he has never met in his or her life ever! I was infuriated and told him no. He told me that I can\u2019t just say no because he\u2019s gonna take me to court where a judge will decide. \n\nI was crying and screaming and asking why he was doing this. He told me he was sorry but he\u2019s ready to be a father and he wants to be there for our daughter. When I told him I was going to fight him with every fiber of my being to make sure he got nothing he told me I was being ridiculous and I need to grow up. \n\nI\u2019ve told my family and friends and almost all of them have told me I need to give him a chance and that I\u2019m just being a bitch. The only person that agrees with me is my mother who watched me get torn apart by my fathers constant jumping in and out of my life when I was a child. I know that this is going to be a hard fight and ultimately it is the courts decision but I just feel like I need to fight this. AITA for being so against him getting any custody?\n\nEdit: for all the people that are confused about age. We met in late teens. Got pregnant when I was 23 and he was 24. I\u2019m 30 now and he\u2019s 31.\n\nEdit2: for all the people that are saying I\u2019m TA for not getting an abortion. Thanks! BUT I remember asking if I was an ass for telling my ex I\u2019ll fight him over custody. Please stop telling me I should have aborted my 7 year old daughter. It\u2019s very much too late and I never asked for your opinion on that matter.", "My ex husband and I divorced when my daughter was only 5yo. It was a messy divorce which ended in him getting primary custoy. I could have her every other weekend. Our marriage hit the rocks after the death of my twin sister. Depression hit me hard and I became an alcoholic. I willingly gave him primary custody so that she could have a better life. From then on, I strived to improve my life. I did AA, went to rehab and I've been sober for a long time now. By the time my daughter was 9, I was completely sober. I looked forward to our visits. I was really heartbroken that I didn't get much time with her. \n\nHe remarried and I was really happy that she had a good family to take care of her. But over the years, her stepmom completely replaced me. She called her mom( I don't resent it, but it definitely stung ). She completely took my place at her school events, and after a while, my daughter didn't even inform me about anything in her life. I could clearly tell that she was no longer eager to visit me. I was not financially strong and could not afford all the things that her stepmom could afford for her.\n\nAt her graduation, she introduced her as her mother to other parents and I only got one picture with her. I was crushed. And when she turned 18, she asked her stepmom to adopt her. That broke my heart. She did not contact me much after that.\n\nI moved to a different state after that. Moved on with my life and I met an amazing man who is now my husband. We have a daughter together. I've completely moved on and I don't resent anyone. I have a great job, a loving husband and an adorable daughter. I'm content. I don't regret or resent anything. \n\nRecently, my bio daughter contacted me and wanted to meet up wuth me. She's 28 now. According to her, she was kicked out of her house after my husband divorced her mother. She fell into depression, did drugs, skipped college and she's jobless. She's pregnant now and she wants me to help her. She apologized to me because she hurt me at that time. According to her, her mother manipulated her. \n\nIdk. I don't feel any connection between us now. Honestly, I've moved on and that chapter of my life is closed now. I don't want to open that wound ever. I don't think it will do any good for my mental health and I'm scared of the impact it might have on my young daughter. I don't think I can or should have her back in my life. WIBTA here??\n\nEdit: I've talked to my ex and he told me that the step mom was a gold digger and cheated on him. But my daughter dropped out of college on her own because of her depression and started doing drugs. He tried to help her out but she never improved. So he finally kicked her out an year ago and never contacted her again. He adviced me not to take her in. He doesn't know that she's pregnant.\n\nEdit2: I'm helping her find a place to stay and a sponsor for support group. I'm not letting her stay with me for now. I have explained to her that if she's not sober she will lose the custody of the baby and she told me that she'll do her best. Thanks for all the replies. ( And I learned the spelling of lose.)", "The son of one of my husband's family friends showed up to my wedding in his marines formal wear, complete with all his medals. Now, I have nothing against anyone in the military but this was a black tie optional wedding and frankly it felt very out of place and it seemed like he was just trying to show off. My wedding had over 300 guests and nobody else felt the need to wear something to make them stand out.\n\nUp until the point that I asked him to leave, he of course was acting very well mannered and like a complete gentleman, as one might expect from a member of the armed forces, and there were even a few excited teenage girls at my wedding who wanted to take a picture with him, to which he graciously agreed. Many people were thanking him for his service, and frankly it just felt like the only reason he wore that was to be in the spotlight and make it about him, which I don't think you are supposed to do at someone else's wedding. If he wants to wear that to his own wedding then fine, but the whole point of having a dress code at a wedding is so that no one guest will stand out too much.  I felt that he should have known this, since the whole point of uniforms in the military is so that you don't stand out from everyone else!\n\nI felt kind of bad about asking him to leave, but it just didn't feel right for him to be there like that.\n\nAITA?", "I (22F) was adopted as an infant and never really knew much about my biological family since it was a closed adoption. I received infrequent letters and photos from my biological mother. I connected with my mother, half sister and aunt during my freshman year of high school. I still really don\u2019t know anything about my family because my biological mother  is a chronic liar. However, she did tell me that my father was no longer  around and had no interest in meeting me. I talked to my half sister and she said that she was told by our grandmother that it was due to him being a familial relation. I did some research, and was able to corroborate with DNA testing that he is indeed my mother\u2019s first cousin. Obviously that was shocking, and I feel like my existence was a mistake. I\u2019ve been struggling with it. Thankfully, from what I\u2019ve read, there\u2019s very minimal genetic overlap in that kind of relationship and I don\u2019t have any medical issues. I do wear contacts, have ADHD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Auditory Processing Disorder, and I\u2019m prone to getting lung infections (mother smoked while pregnant). But none of these are major in the slightest and I live a very normal, slightly more anxious, life. I\u2019m in a relationship right now, I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll last or if it\u2019ll last. I would love to eventually marry him but I\u2019m 22 and I\u2019m  being a realist here. WIBTA if I didn\u2019t tell him since there\u2019s virtually no chance our kids would have issues....and also I\u2019m scared that he would break up with me because of it. \n\nAlso before anyone makes any Kentucky/Rolltide, my bio family is from Ashland, KY. My life is a meme at this point\n\nEdit: I honestly did not think this would blow up so much. Really glad this is a throwaway. I guess some info for people.\n\n1. My mother didn\u2019t know she and my father were related. Growing up she never knew her mother\u2019s side of the family as my grandmother abandoned them for her second family. My parents were very much in love and dated as teenagers, it wasn\u2019t a sexually abusive situation. They went to the same high school and they didn\u2019t look related in the slightest, or share the same last name (I think their mothers were siblings). Mother found out when grandma got a divorce and came back into her life, I think they my parents were 18-19 \nbecause it was right after high school. \n\n2. Boyfriend and I have been together about a year, which isn\u2019t long but I can see it leading to marriage. Also he\u2019s not American, so no chance of us being related! Trying to keep it out of the family. \n\n3. Views of incest are a bit different here in America for you non Americans. Especially since I live in a very religious area, my family are strict Catholics. It\u2019s not illegal everywhere, but it is in some states.\n\n**Edit 2** This blew up like crazy and I was certainly not expecting it! I really appreciate all the kind words and reassurance!  Ive been in my own head about this and I appreciate that so many of you are willing to offer advice!", "I was asked by a female coworker to lift something heavy in the kitchen while I was working at my desk, but when I got to the kitchen, it was filled with other women having a conversation during working hours. I was offended that she would go out of her way to ask me while I was working just because I was the nearest available man, so I refused. The other women were clearly offended by my decision and some thought I was joking, so I kept on refusing until one of the women gets fed up and lifts the dang thing with ease. I thought one of them should have done it in the first place.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: To clarify, the women in the break room weren\u2019t on official breaks. They just happened to be there because they all needed a second round of coffee and started a conversation amongst themselves. There are no official break times in my workplace. Also, I was working on something at my desk when I was asked to lift said object.\n\nEdit 2: At the time of being asked, I was asked to help \u201clift something\u201d in the break room. I assumed it was a package of mail or paper and I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be doing it myself, nor did I know it was merely to replace a five-gallon bottle of water for the water dispenser.\n\nEdit 3: This was not the first time in the day I refilled the dispenser. I\u2019m the closest man who sits near the break room, so I\u2019m regularly asked by superiors to change it and am not in a place to refuse my boss. However, the woman who asked me is not a superior and isn\u2019t exactly petite either \u2014 none of them in the break room are. Furthermore, the cap on the bottle is one of those that prevents spills by being pierced when it\u2019s placed on the dispenser. I have also witnessed a 4\u201911\u201d woman change the bottle, so height isn\u2019t exactly much of an issue here.\n\nEdit 4: The woman who asked me does not have a poor relationship with the other women in the break room. She is also married with children and I\u2019m the only openly gay man in the office, so, no, I highly doubt she was trying to flirt with me as suggested by some here.\n\nEdit 5: I never lost my temper or became argumentative during all this, but some here assume I did. I just refused to do the task for her.\n\nEdit 6: I am not the strongest person in the office \u2014 far from it. I don\u2019t lift weights and stay slim out of preference. We even have some female gym fanatics here. Also, I barely know the woman who asked me. She\u2019s in another department in another part of the office.\n\nUPDATE: I very much wanted your responses because of a follow-up discussion with one of my female coworkers who was within earshot when all this happened. She still defends chivalry, while I obviously find it illogical. Our office is currently going through a renovation and, while clearing out a storage room, we discovered our old water dispenser involved in all this. Yes, everything I posted happened almost a decade ago. Our discovery sparked a heated discussion and I wanted to put the issue on this subreddit for others\u2019 viewpoints to close our debate. I put little effort in my original post without thinking I\u2019d get so many responses, so my apologies in advance for the list of edits.\n\nI\u2019m still employed with this company, and some involved have left. If there was any hostility towards me afterwards, it was not noticeable and certainly played no role in my eventual promotion. I\u2019m glad to have played a part in changing the minds of my female colleagues. It\u2019s no longer a habit for them to look for a man when some physical exertion is involved, and I am often told by women to let them handle tasks once exclusively done by men. Our head of HR also announced in a staff meeting that we\u2019ll be employing more men to bridge the gender gap in our office, and some married coworkers told me they\u2019ve even made positive changes at home as well \u2014 all stemming from a seemingly petty ordeal.", "Background: My sister and I have never gotten along. I don't know why, I wish I did so I could fix it but so it goes. I had invited her to come country dancing with me every time I was home, but she never wanted to go.\n\nMy date for the wedding was my swing dance partner. We tore up the floor all night long. Any time a country song was on, we'd go dance whether the dance floor was empty or full. We were having a blast which was great because I really didn't want to be there since my sister put my ex of 7 years in the bridal party (the groom didn't really know him at all and turns out he doesn't really like the groom). My dance partner asked my sister if she wanted to dance at least three times, she declined, and danced quite a few times with the maid of honor who doesn't swing dance, but can sure follow a lead and killed it!\n\nA few members of my family have told me that my dancing at the wedding was inappropriate and I should have toned it down. They have even gone so far as to tell me that I hired a professional dancer to be my date (he isn't... I met him Jr year of college when we started dancing weekly together at a bar)\n\nSo my question is, am I the asshole for dancing like I know how to dance or should I have dialed it back a but for the wedding?\n\nEdit: Just so it's not hidden in the comments because it's been the center of why most think I'm the asshole, we were doing aerials, not every song, but they were there. \n\nI've seen some follow up with thank yous and such on the AITA posts, but since this is my first timing posting I'm not sure when to do that. Thanks everyone, you all are right, I didn't think that I had done anything wrong coming into this, but wanted to get the crowd opinion. It seems like popular vote is I made an ass of myself. I just wanted to say thanks for the perspective check. You all gave me some stuff to think about. I had never heard the etiquette rules about aerials either, so that's good to know now too. I always thought that was just a bar rule.", "Me (50sM)\n\nMy daughter (32/f)\n\nMy son (27/m)\n\nI love my kids equally.  \n\nMy daughter lives at home rent free, which has allowed her to pursue her passion.  We don\u2019t charge her rent and so she\u2019s built up a good deal of savings (~50k).  \n\nMy son is a bit more aimless.  He has a college degree, but he and his girlfriend have chosen to pursue a more nomadic lifestyle.  He supports them (gf doesn\u2019t work) and does odd jobs/gigs.  They have lived in Airbnbs for two years, until about a month ago.\n\nLast week, my son came to me to speak in private.  Apparently, they have been living off of credit cards and now my son owes ~30k.  There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll be able to pay that off on his current job.  He has moved back in and is looking for more steady work, but it\u2019s going slowly as he has little career history to speak of.  Meanwhile, the creditors are calling constantly.  The debt will inevitably grow with interest.  My wife is pushing hard for son to file for bankruptcy to manage this. \n\nI don\u2019t want my son to file for bankruptcy.  It would be a huge stain on his credit and make some jobs impossible to get.  I believe my daughter should loan him the money out of her savings.  When I pass all my children will have is each other.  They should learn how to rely on each other more.  \n\nI told my daughter I think she should loan son the money.  She got extremely angry and left to live with her mom.  Her mom, my wife, and my daughter are all angry at me now.  \n\nAITA?\n\nETA: hey everyone!  It's Vish, or \"son\" I guess lol.  It's been an interesting time being the most hated dude on Reddit, but my dad won't be answering more questions or responding to comments.  Honestly I didn't even know my dad knew what Reddit was, so getting to the first page has been an experience to say the least.  \n\nI know I fucked up, and I'm working hard to make it right.  My sister works incredibly hard for her money and I would never ever accept a dime from her.", "For a friend's birthday I got him a budget record player from Amazon along with 10 old vinyls from a second hand shop. He is pretty into music so I thought it would be a cool gift. Plus I'm tight on money to give him anything more expensive.\n\nAfter I gave him the presents at the birthday party he opened it to test it out. Here enters Pretentious Music Snob (PMS), he starts fiddling with the record player, as soon as my friend opened the package.\n\nPMS: (asking me) How much did you get it for?\n\nMe: 60 dollars.\n\nPMS: (friend's name) be careful of the needle. It's a cheap vinyl player and it might scratch the records.\n\nI thought that was a weird thing to say, considering that he was right in front of me, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt since it might actually be useful advice.\n\nMy friend put on a vinyl and it started playing. \n\nPMS: The speakers sound pretty crap.\n\nFriend: I think it sounds fine.\n\nPMS: You know what you can do? You should take out the speakers from the player and rewire it to better speakers to improve the sound. Here's the setup I have at home. (Pulls out his phone, starts showing him stuff) The one that xxx gave you is like the cheapest record player you can buy so it's not going to give you a good sound.\n\nAt this point I was pretty annoyed. He might be right, but I think it's a dick move to straight up say that my gift crap when I was right next to him. So I decided to call him out.\n\nMe: Hey look, if you think that my gift is trash, why didn't you get him something better yourself instead of a 20 dollar gift card? (Yes, he got him a 20 dollar gift card for my friend's 18th)\n\nThe room became silent and it got pretty awkward. I know that it's the thought that counts and it's bad to compare the value of the presents that you give, me calling PMS out about the value of his gift might be shallow and petty, but I reckon that he deserves it for talking shit about my gift right in front of me.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: I posted this before going to bed (I live in Australia) and woke up in the morning expecting like 50 comments but Holy Crap this blew up. Here's some additional info:\n\nWhen birthday friend opened the present, everyone gathered around and was watching because we're (mostly) 18 year old who have never seen a record player at work before. So when PMS was pointing out the flaws in my gift, it was to everyone at the party since all the attention was on the record player, and thus him at that moment. \n\nTo be honest I'm not a confrontational person and I wouldn't have said anything until the point where he pulled out his phone and showed birthday friend what he thought would be better gifts, that was the last straw for me. I said what I said to A) shut him up, I wasn't in the mood for listening to him saying how bad my gift was for 10 more minutes B) Yes I said it in a way that embarrassed him. I'm not a saint, I didn't take the high road, but I sure as hell feel good about standing up for myself. \n\nWhen I said the room went silent and awkward, it was like for 10 second. I've apologised to birthday friend over text for making a scene, he said to not worry about since PMS was also annoying him. \n\nI posted this to see if my response was appropriate and that I didn't over escalate it. My conclusion is that sometimes you gotta be an asshole yourself to stand up to a bully and I don't regret what I did.", "So as I write this I'm feeding my 7 week old son. I am totally in love with him, he is amazing. However... The process of bringing him into the world was not good. At. All.\n\nIn order to explain why i might be an asshole I think its important to explain the circumstances surrounding my sons birth.\n\nI had incredibly bad morning sickness, to the point that I weighed less at the end of my pregnancy than before I conceived (my bmi was 23 pre pregnancy). I could barely walk due to bad hips, my stomach muscles tore apart, and I got a ridiculous number of stretch marks all across my stomach and back.\n\nThen came labour and delivery. I was in labour for 92 hours. My son was back to back, so i was in agony. I had two failed epidurals, ended up on gas and air, paracetamol, and morphine, and still spent hours screaming into the abyss. In the end his heart rate dropped and I had to have him delivered in theatre by ventouse.\n\nI ended up with a second degree vaginal tear, which got infected. My son was ill following delivery and ended up in the NICU for a few days. I had issues breastfeeding once he was out of NICU, and ended up getting mastitis twice within a week, before my milk supply dried out totally. I spent 12 days in hospital total before going home.\n\nOnce home my son got ill again and ended up back in hospital on three occasions.\n\nHe's finally better and we are finally a normal happy family at home.\n\n\n\n\nSo why AITA?\n\nWell, before I got pregnant / gave birth people would tell me how magical pregnancy was and how giving birth wasn't that bad and that you forget the pain as soon as you hold your baby etc. Which, pardon my French, is bollocks. I still remember every moment of pain and currently don't believe I could mentally deal with another pregnancy.\n\nPart of the reason I think I have struggled so much emotionally with all the issues I had was that my experience totally jarred with my expectations. Nobody told me that everything can go wrong. I didn't expect my birth plan to go as I hoped, but i thought I might get some things I wanted. I never expected to have such difficulties feeding my son. I didn't prepare for him being ill. I didn't prepare for feeling totally helpless and useless.\n\nSo when my childless friends (who planned on having children in the future) asked me how labour and delivery went, I was totally honest.\n\nI didn't sugar coat anything. I explained everything exactly as it was, and told them of the problems we had as they happened. I have been very honest in saying that whilst my son was worth all the pain, I probably won't be doing it again.\n\nWell my friends have said that I'm an asshole for being so honest as I've put them off having children in the future. I didn't mean to scare them, but I felt that I would have rather had more realistic expectations of what could happen.\n\nI don't feel like I should apologise or say that I exaggerated anything to make them feel better, but maybe I'm wrong.\n\nSo reddit AITA?", "So my 15 year old daughter is in her first \"serious\" relationship with a boy she was friends with before they started dating.  I put serious in quotes because while they spend time together frequently, they are only ever alone in public places like the mall.  My daughter and I have a good relationship and she has shared that they haven't done anything more than kiss at this point.  I am not naive enough to think they couldn't be doing more, but my daughter has given me no reason to mistrust her.\n\nThe problem is that the more time they spend together, the more demanding of her time the boyfriend is becoming.  He calls and texts her constantly and gets upset when she doesn't respond immediately.  She has explained to him that she is not tied to her phone, especially during the summer when she is doing things outside or with friends.  He has told her that he worries about her when she doesn't answer, and if she really loved him she wouldn't make him worry.  She recognizes this as manipulation and has told him that it is not okay.\n\nShe sat him down and explained that she does not like how demanding and controlling he is becoming, and explained that if he doesn't stop she will break up with him.  I was very proud of the way she handled it.  We have taught both of our kids that it is important to define your boundaries and then expect the people around you to respect them, as well as taking the time to understand and respect the boundaries of others.  I think this is especially important as they navigate their teenage years.\n\nLast night while she to a 30 minute bath he called her 7 times and sent her over 30 texts that started with him just saying \"Babe, call me\" and culminated in him saying there would be consequences for her ignoring him.  It was the last straw, and she told him she was done.  He then blew up her phone until she blocked him and removed him from all of her social media.  He then started contacting all of the people in their shared group of friends, trying to get them to talk her into giving him another chance.  She.  Is.  Done.\n\nAs a mom, I would want to know if my son (13M) was treating someone like this.  I recognize that this is a learning experience for both of them, and hope that this boy can learn to have healthier relationships on the future.  WIBTA for contacting his mom and letting her know everything that has been going on?  We have chatted in the past, and I have her contact info, so it would be easy to get in touch with her.  Or would I be overstepping my bounds by getting involved, since at this point my daughter seems to have done a good job of handling things on her own?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:  I talked with my daughter tonight and told her that I was considering calling his mom to discuss his behavior.  (For the record, I would have done this even without all of the suggestions to do so.  I respect her enough to keep her in the loop.)  I explained that I don't think she could have handled the situation any better than she did, and I am so proud of her for advocating for herself and her boundaries.  But I have concerns about the way he continues to stomp those boundaries and try to manipulate her.  I am also concerned about his future relationships if he doesn't make some serious changes, which probably won't happen without some intervention.\n\nShe was not upset at all and said she understood why I would want to call his mom.  She asked that I wait a couple of days to see if he stops the behaviors on his own.  We agreed that if he is still trying to call and text her and her friends by Friday, I will make the call.  As a side note, the friends he has contacted have all told him that he needs to give her space and understand why she broke up with him.  She is lucky to really have a great group of friends.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, for those of you who have asked... From a very early age we have always emphasized the importance of boundaries with our kids.  We never forbid them from being friends with kids we saw as potential bad influences, but focused on what makes a good friend.  When problems arose, we would talk to them and help them see when someone wasn't respecting them (or when they weren't respecting others).  So her recognizing that he was being manipulative and needy was an extension of that.  I'm so happy that years of those types of conversations worked and she has a very good grasp on what health interactions look like!", "I'm half Japanese and my family recently moved into my stepdad's house.  I speak English with my brothers but Japanese with my mom. At the dinner table, my stepdad will get angry if we speak Japanese because he feels left out.  He frequently stands up and declares that he is left out and leaves the room to watch TV.\n\nI have major problems with him as he frequently trash talks my dad and screams at us.\n\nI live in Australia and my mother is the only connection I have with my Japanese heritage and being able to speak Japanese is really important to me.\n\nI don't feel obligated to speak English around him just because he wants to hear what I'm talking to my mom about.\n\nEdit:  To clarify Japanese is the only language I have ever spoke with my mom and it feels incredibly weird speaking English with her. I speak Japanese with her even around other people e.g my dad or friends and family.", "I know the title sounds bad but hear me out.\n\nI'm 47F, my husband is 49M, my son is 28M, his fiancee is 27F.\n\nWhen my son proposed, we talked to both he and his fiancee to find out their game plans for the future. We wanted to buy them a house but one question decided *how big*: do they plan on having children?\n\nTheir answer was \"yes\", so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. Because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. At least in our names, our family is protected. We think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing.\n\nThey've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this October. But we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. This is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. But it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption.\n\nWe would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. But instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. This is like the difference of a factor of two. We spent our money needlessly.\n\nI'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. My husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. I don't think they did it with malice \"hehe we get a bigger house if we lie\", but I think they knew they didn't want children. You don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right?\n\nWould I be the asshole for selling their home? We'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. They'd never be homeless.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nJust so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. The problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. Children need extra space. Now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house.\n\nOur other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. Same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. In our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. This is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. There's already been hubbub between my children \"why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom\", etc. \"Because they're having children\" can't be our reasoning anymore.", "Just as a little background, I grew up in a very strict Christian family where I wasn\u2019t allowed to cut my hair, ever, because \u201chair is a woman\u2019s crown\u201d. It was down to my knees by the time I escaped at 18. Ever since then I\u2019ve either had a pixie, a buzz cut or have been totally bald, because I cannot stand the heavy feeling of long hair or all the brushing/washing/detangling after dealing with it for so many years. So that\u2019s a big reason I\u2019m so stubborn about this issue. Also, all of my friends involved in this story have always known me as the girl with no hair. Right now I\u2019m bald because I always shave my head completely for the summer. \n\nOne of my good friends is getting married in August and she chose me to be one of her bridesmaids. Everything had been cool, she\u2019s always been the sweetest person and she showed no signs of going Bridezilla before this, until she called me up about three weeks ago and asked me if I could do her a favor and wear a wig to her wedding. She explained that she wanted all of her bridesmaids to match and that she wanted us all to look good in the pictures. I told her I really didn\u2019t want to get a wig, and we\u2019ve been on bad terms ever since.\n\nAll of our friends are on her side because \u201cit\u2019s just a wig\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s not like she\u2019s asking you to grow out your hair for the wedding, so she\u2019s not the one being unreasonable.\u201d And I know I can be very stubborn sometimes, which I guess is the reason I\u2019m posting here. \n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t know how many of you will be aware of this but a wig that will actually look good/realistic is expensive. I\u2019ve already paid for a bridesmaid\u2019s dress, new shoes, and plane tickets, as well as a small deposit for the person who\u2019s going to do our makeup. This wedding has already cost me a fortune. I could afford a wig if I wanted to, but do I really want to spend the money on something I\u2019ll never wear again when I\u2019ve already spent a ton? Not really.\n\nAlso, this is going to be on a plantation in Louisiana. In August. I\u2019m already going to be hot and uncomfortable, and a wig will make things a thousand times worse. \n\nMy biggest reason-and this is why my friends are saying I\u2019m the asshole-is the principle of the thing. I feel like it implies I look bad because I don\u2019t have hair, which I personally don\u2019t think is true. Is being bald so hideous I\u2019ll ruin her pictures? Is she going to make her balding father wear a toupee? And I think the \u201cI want us to match\u201d thing is stupid. We\u2019re already wearing matching dresses, why isn\u2019t that enough? I know it\u2019s \u201cher day\u201d and we\u2019re supposed to make her happy, but isn\u2019t there a line? \n\nI\u2019ve offered to wear a cute headscarf as a compromise if my bald head is that offensive, but she\u2019s not having it. I\u2019m still in the bridal party and invited but I don\u2019t know for how much longer, honestly. AITA for not wanting to wear a wig?\n\nEDIT: Just to add two things: 1. She\u2019s not willing to pay or reimburse me for the wig, in part or in full 2. Along with the headscarf I\u2019d also be willing to grow my hair out into a pixie cut, the wedding is at the beginning of August so it\u2019d still be really short though.", "I want to preface this by saying that I\u2019ve been 100% financially independent from my parents since the day I graduated college. I know they don\u2019t owe me a dime and I\u2019m grateful for everything they\u2019ve given me in life. \n\nI have a sister who is about a decade older than me, and my parents promised each of us a set amount of money towards our weddings. My sister used this money to have a big, beautiful wedding and I\u2019m happy my parents were able to help make her special day like something out of a fairytale. Now it\u2019s my turn to get married, but my parents have admitted to me that they gave away the money they had saved for my wedding to my sister. \n\nMy sister, a mother of one, had a series of health problems and had to freeze her eggs if she ever wanted to have another child. She didn\u2019t have the money and only had a few weeks before her hysterectomy so she asked my parents for the $13,000, which they obviously gave her. My sister was absolutely devastated by her health issues and scared, and because they\u2019re great people, my parents were willing to do anything to make her feel better. \n\nI know I sound like a selfish, vapid bitch for prioritizing my wedding over her fertility, but she was 36 when she got the diagnosis. There was no telling how long it would take for her health to recover, and it would be years before they could even afford supporting another infant, let alone the tens of thousands a surrogate would cost. I knew she would never have the means to use those eggs before she was 40, and she has made it very clear that she wouldn\u2019t want to have an infant at that age. In my opinion, she acted in panic and wanted a safety net that she knew she would never use. I don\u2019t blame her for being scared. I would have been terrified to. \n\nBut I\u2019m still upset that now I won\u2019t be able to have much of a wedding because I had been counting on the funds my parents had promised. I\u2019m not so much upset that they gave it to her, but I am upset that they gave it to her *knowing* nothing would ever come of it. That they traded my wedding day for her brief peace of mind. My sister has confirmed already that she and her husband will not be having another child. \n\nWhen my parents told me there was no money, they were obviously stricken and apologetic. I couldn\u2019t hide my disappointment. I really tried to reassure them that I understood, but they could tell I was hurt. My sister called later and told me that it sucks I can\u2019t have a \u2018fancy wedding\u2019 (like hers) but basically I need to grow up. Which seemed hypocritical, since she made such a big deal out of her wedding needing to be extravagant. She said she\u2019s sorry, but at the time her future children were more important than one day in my life not being as nice as I\u2019d hoped. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t the end of the world. This is dumb and petty in the grand scheme of things and I feel ridiculously shallow for being so upset over losing my dream wedding. I\u2019m still getting married. My wedding won\u2019t compare to my sister\u2019s, but I\u2019m still marrying the love of my life and it will still be an awesome day. \n\nThanks for sticking with me through the story. I know plenty of you are rolling your eyes over the dramatic bullshit that comes with weddings. So, am I overreacting? AITA?\n\n", "This whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\nEDIT: It's funny y'all keep mentioning Freud. My boyfriend is studying psychology and actually obsessed with Jung. Like y'all know that post about that guy who was obsessed with Jordan Peterson to the point his girlfriend left him? He's that level obsessed with Jung. \ud83e\uddd0", "I (17M) was horrendously bullied by this guy, we can call Jake (17M). Jake was quite popular and sociable but for some reason kept targeting me, calling me names, slurs, etc. I hated him so much, I'd hate going to school and him being in class. I dreaded it.\n\nWell we found out that Jake unexpectedly passed away in his sleep. When I saw this on Facebook, I saw lots of RIP posts from classmates, but my first reaction was relief. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders.\n\nWhen I came to class, people were crying and my teacher (50F) said we need to take a moment silence for him. After the silence was done, I just said out loud ''I don't care that Jake died. He was a bully''. People looked at me instantly and gave me death stares, I could hear some people muttering swear words.\n\nBut then some people came up to me and thanked me, they said they hated Jake too. Honestly I'm fucking glad he's dead. I feel so much better about my life now. Some classmates called me AH, his girlfriend (ex now lol) came up to me and called me every name under the sun, AH was one of them. I just said to her ''You need to calm down and relax'' and walked away. \n\nI honestly feel good and so do some other classmates. AITA?\n\n**Edit - The reason I say 'now ex lol' is because she chose to be in a relationship with an awful, awful person. That's bad character judgement on her part, and also complacency.**\n\n**Edit 2 - Way too many comments to read....Gonna sign off for a bit and read them later. I have had many helpful PM's. Thank you to those who reached out.**", "I\u2019m a gen 1.5 Indian migrant to the UK (was born in India but moved when I was 6 with parents) so while I grew up British and consider myself to be British, I still have family in India and my Indian heritage is an important part of my identity. My wife is 4th gen Indian - her family immigrated decades ago so she, and her parents grew up fully anglicised. I\u2019d like to stress there\u2019s nothing wrong with that - why should she have ties to a country her grandparents were born in?\n\nDue to the difference in culture we are having two weddings - one in England for all her family and our friends, and one in India for the rest of my family and friends there. We had the first wedding, which was very traditional and western  - church, reception etc. It was great, and we had fun. Now the wedding in India - it\u2019s important as my grandparents are too old to fly to the UK so I\u2019d love for them to see me get married. \n\nThe problem comes with the menu - in a Hindu wedding, and especially in the south, you don\u2019t serve meat. You just don\u2019t. In fact, what\u2019s served at a wedding is something called a [sadya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhya). It\u2019s fully vegetarian, and served on a banana leaf - super traditional. My wife says we should allow meat, despite the cultural taboo - saying her side of the family \u2018won\u2019t be able to cope\u2019 without meat. I\u2019m of the opinion that they\u2019re all adults, and they can live with the inconvenience - hell, if it\u2019s that bad run to a KFC after the ceremony and gorge yourself - but at the wedding itself, no meat. It\u2019s also not like there won\u2019t be any meat - there\u2019ll be non veg food at the Sangeet, there\u2019ll be meat at the reception. \n\nAlso during the English wedding I sided with her over my parents over the serving of beef - my parents, being Hindus don\u2019t partake, but I told them they should just eat something else, not ask that beef not be served entirely. \n\nSo, WIBTA for not wanting meat at the wedding?", "I know relationship posts aren't allowed here so I want to keep this focused to the incident at hand. So please don't give any relationship advice.\n\nOkay, so I am a big fan of Seinfeld as I used to watch it every day after school with my dad. I had a poster that was signed by the actors who played the four main characters Jerry, Kramer, Costanza, and Elaine. This poster has always been really important to me because watching seinfield with my dad is one of the few times I got to spend time with him (he had a lot of personal issues) and he personally went and got it signed to give me for my 21st birthday. So yeah, it's not just a dumb poster to me, it has a lot of sentimental value.\n\nNow my wife and I have been trying to raise money to start a college fund for our kids. As you do, we've been selling stuff we don't need anymore, and I guess you can see where this is going. I hadn't been in my study a few weeks as I've been on an extended business trip, and when I come home to my study my poster is gone. I ask my wife where it is and she said she sold it on eBay.\n\nHere's where it gets iffy. She claims she assumed it would be okay to sell since it's just a poster, DESPITE it being so sentimental to me. The reason I am suspect is because she was very unhappy with me going on this business trip. She tried to forbid me going because she couldn't come with me (to make sure I behave myself). However I couldn't say no, I literally had to go or I'd severely hurt my reputation at work. So when I leave we're fighting, when I come back my most prized possession is gone in a \"mistake.\" See where I'm coming from?\n\nI told my wife I was going to stay in a motel for 1-2 weeks, and that if she wants to save this marriage my poster better be back in my study when I get back. She's supposedly been an emotional wreck ever since (according to her sister).\n\nAITA? My friends think I am having a hissy fit and need to grow up", "Me and my wife recently found out that her daughter (my step-daughter, though I consider her close enough to my own after having raised her for 18 years) has taken out about $60,000 in loan debt under our name, without our permission. For some basic context, she took out a Parent Plus Loan for school, under our name and social security number, without asking us. In her first semester of her Freshman Year, she did come to us, asking if we would fill out the paperwork for her, since her school's loans were only for about $5000 for the whole year. We explained that we didn't have the financial means to take out a loan for the amount she was requesting; about $14,000 a year, but offered to help her find scholarships or work-study, and other ways to potentially help her cover her costs. After me and her applied for about 5-10 scholarships, and she got a part-time job, she never came back to me and my wife with any financial aid concerns again, so we figured that she had largely figured it up. We brought up tuition a couple times, but every time we'd ask, she'd just say that she was able to cover it all, and didn't need any help with it or anything.\n\nCome us, a couple years down the road. We've gotten a letter from the Department of Education saying that 'our' loan has gone into default, and has been so for about a year at this point. We reach out to her school and, after a little bit of digging, we discover that after we had told her \"no\" on the loan, she had gone around our back and applied for it all online. She filled in her own contact information instead of our own, and the loan went through just fine, since she had the correct Social Security Numbers and all. We've spoken with the school and the DoE a fair amount about this already, and we basically have 2 options for this. We can either eat the loan, and pay it all back ourselves (something not at all financially feasible for my family, since we have about $40k in Medical Debt on top of this now), or to go through the state to press charges on each one of the 5 loans she's taken out; each loan being over $10,000, making this a Felony in my state with a minimum prison sentence. At this point, I'm not certain what my family \\*can\\* do. We don't have the money to be able to pay this loan back, but me and my wife are emotionally wrecked at even the thought of pressing charges against our own daughter. So, here's the important question, reddit: if I press charges here, AITA?\n\nEdit: Since there's a little bit of confusion, a bit of clarification. A Plus Loan is a loan that we would take out in our own name, to give her extra funds for education. Because we would ordinarily be the ones taking it out, she's not involved with the Repayment Process at all; she's not even technically eligible to make payments towards it, since it's under our own name.  \n\n\nEdit 2: I promised myself I would never do anything stupid like this if I ever had a post blow up, but now I truly understand what RIP Inbox means. I really truly would like to thank everyone here for their support; I know reddit is one of the few places I can make a post and expect to get a reply.  \n\n\nIn reality, even though I've gotten a huge outpouring of support saying I WNBTA (is that a thing? idk) if me and my wife go through with this, I'm still 100% split about how I actually want to go. You guys have given me a lot to chew on, and I'd really like to thank you all.", "I was on a call with my sister, who was giving me some usual gossip about people we know from back home, when she tells me about a family friend Dina who has just recently become sexually active with her boyfriend. I asked my sister how she knew Dina was sexually active, and she told me she heard it from my mom. \n\nI know that Dina is super private and comes from a really conservative household, and wouldn't dare tell her parents about her being sexually active. I asked my sister how my mom knew, and apparently my mom's best friend, let's call her Miss Annie (not Dina's mother) is very good friends with Dina's PCP, who told her the gossip. I work in healthcare, and I feel like this HAS to be a HIPAA violation, so I told my sister I might have to report Dina's PCP. \n\nWIBTA if I report her? My sister told me I shouldn't because \"you'll be ruining that doctor's life and her family over 'just a bit of gossip'\" (she has two small children and is in the process of moving her husband over to the US from abroad) and that I should just \"mind my own business.\" My best friend (who also knows Dina well) said that I don't have any proof to report her over just \"hearsay\" and \"gossip.\" However this situation isn't sitting right with me.\n\nEDIT: Hey guys! So after heavy consideration, I scheduled a three way call between my sister, Dina and I to talk about this. I'll keep you all updated! Thanks for all your input everyone :)", "Two days ago, my 16 year old son came to my wife and I freaked out. He said he\u2019s scared for his life and he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do. We had to calm him down and to make a long story short, he thinks he got his girlfriend pregnant. He said she missed her period weeks ago and he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do because he\u2019s not ready to be a father. His girlfriend is vehemently pro-life, so there\u2019s not anything he can do.\n\nI asked him how could this happen; why wasn\u2019t she taking her reproductive health seriously and be on birth control, and ESPECIALLY, why isn\u2019t he especially not taking him reproductive seriously by using condoms. He said that his girlfriend\u2019s parents are strict, so she has no way to access them, and to condoms, he said and I quote \u201cCondoms feel like having sex with a thick garbage bag.\u201d Apparently, they relied on the calendar method and pulling out because \u201ctogether, it\u2019s almost impossible to get pregnant.\u201d\n\nI was **infuriated**. I\u2019ve talked to him ALL the time about safe sex. We\u2019re no prudes; we knew that once he got a girlfriend, he\u2019d start having sex. Which is why we emphasized being *safe*. We\u2019ve just have had this conversation so many times; I was just so. Angry. That my son would do this to his life, and potentially wreck his entire life. \n\nI told him that this was his fuck-up, and he has to take responsibility. Effective immediately, he is going to have to get a job and work 40 hours a week and start building a savings. Additionally, he has shown that we cannot trust him to make responsible decisions, and he\u2019s effectively grounded until the end of the year. He can spend time with his friends at our house only, with all the doors open, and he cannot go upstairs with any girl at all. He can also only do this only when we\u2019re home (we live in a gated community so this is easily enforceable). That means no sleepovers, no parties, no going to the pool (unless we go with him), no nothing. If he wants to go somewhere like out to eat with his friends, we\u2019ll use find my iPhone to track him. He said he understood.\n\nHe came to us today with great news; his girlfriend got her period. He asked now that she\u2019s not really pregnant, can the punishment be less strict, and that he promises to start using condoms now, but my wife and I want to stick to our guns on this. Though with the added stipulation that he can work 20 hours a week instead, and it can be a mixture of volunteer and actual work. But he\u2019s shown us he\u2019s downright irresponsible and we just plainly cannot trust him until he matures. \n\nMy son maintains that we\u2019re being WAY to harsh, and that he realizes his mistake now, but he\u2019s also said in the past that he\u2019d never have sex without a condom because \u201che\u2019s not an idiot.\u201d We just plainly cannot trust him right now. Are we being unreasonable?\n\nEDIT: The work thing would've just been for the summer. Sorry for the confusion; we agree that there's no way on Earth he could manage that many hours during the school year.", "I have insufferable in laws. Father in law is manageable, but mother in law is crazy.\n\nMy wife is Chinese and her parents are really traditional. Privacy means nothing to them, and my wife refuses to set boundaries. They will come around every day unannounced to visit my wife/play with our kids. So not only do I never get a break from my mother in laws constant nagging, I have no privacy from them.\n\nWife has ignored my concerns for years. To be fair, she\u2019s in a tough spot as standing up to Chinese parents is a pain I guess.\n\nAnyway, mother in law is arachnophobic. A few months ago she went crazy after a (wolf?) spider was simply in the corner doing nothing. Panic attack and all.\n\nSo I got the idea to get a tarantula as a way to prevent her coming so often. It\u2019s in a big enclosure in the living room. Asked wife before hand if it\u2019s okay, but didn\u2019t tell her the motivation. Worked like a charm, the dad still comes but the mother can\u2019t stand to be in the same house as it.\n\nI\u2019m mainly asking if AITA as I wasn\u2019t upfront with my wife. But she\u2019s continued to ignore my concerns about boundaries for years, I don\u2019t think I had a choice. Plus the tarantula makes a cool pet.", "My son is 21 years old and got a girl from work pregnant. Needless to say, I am incredibly disappointed in him and when he told me I was devastated he\u2019d make such a silly mistake. I asked him about an abortion and he broke down and told me he\u2019d worn a condom and he was hoping she\u2019d abort but to no avail. \n\nI have met the future mother of my grandchild in a very awkward meeting one day and it\u2019s clear to me she\u2019s a lovely young lady. However I found out from her (not even my coward son) that he has broken all ties with her and plans only to give child support and not see this baby at all. \n\nI have been texting her and trying to assuage her worries but she is also understandably worried that she won\u2019t have any support and that her baby- my first grandchild- won\u2019t have its father. Obviously I am very much wanting to be in this child\u2019s life also.\n\nOf course I have been trying to speak to my son over and over about this issue and I keep telling him that the deed is done and he needs to just deal with it now. He told me in tears that he never wanted to be a father and he wore protection, as well as the fact they were casual lovers and nothing more. I told him I would withdraw all financial assistance if he wasn\u2019t in this babies life and he told me if that was the case then so be it, so I took his car and phone and bank cards that were attached to my account. \n\nIn response to this, he\u2019s moved in with his father but I have no idea where he lives and he\u2019s not even attempted once to contact me. He told me he was leaving and that I wasn\u2019t supporting him. My own parents are vehemently against him leaving and have said they\u2019ll disown him if he doesn\u2019t come back. \n\nMy partner of 12 years however is very much on my sons side and has told me that he\u2019s disappointed in how I\u2019m handling this. \n\nAITA?", "Title basically sums it up I guess.\n\nDaughter has decided she wants to be a vegetarian. I love meat and it\u2019s very rare for me to go without some kind of meat at dinner. \n\nMy daughter naturally expects me to accommodate and cook vegetarian options for dinner too. I told her that if she wants to be vegetarian she can make her own dinner.\n\nWife told me I should cook veggie dinners for her, but shut up quickly after I asked if she wanted to start cooking dinner instead.\n\nNaturally I am now the asshole in all of this.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: daughter is 17", "This is literally the hot topic of the day for my entire family and I\u2019m fed up of being called an asshole so I\u2019m going to ask on here. \n\nWe are on a family vacation at the moment and we had gone to a park where there were a lot of young families like my own. My 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. They were pretty close by. \n\nMy son is obsessed with his bike and loves it. He had been playing on it for a while, and the other family had a little girl his age that kept looking over. \n\nWhen we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. My mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blas\u00e9 attitude towards belongings and she\u2019s lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn\u2019t attached to material things.\n\nI interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl \u2018why don\u2019t you ask (my son) since it\u2019s his bike?\u2019 She did and my son said no. She looked a little crestfallen but went back to her family and she didn\u2019t seem bothered afterwards. \n\nMy entire family looked at my like I was an evil witch and even my own husbands facial expression was surprised at me. \n\nI got a little defensive and told them that it was our sons toy to lend out as he pleased, and I was a little irritated to hear my mom say to my son \u2018honey, sometimes it\u2019s nice to share\u2019 because he looked upset afterwards. l know that, he knows that, but it\u2019s his new toy and he shouldn\u2019t be made to feel bad over not wanting to share with a total stranger. \n\nAITA?", "Hey guys, short time lurker first time poster, I'm not one to really do this but I'm genuinely wondering if I'm in the wrong.\n\n\nSo my son had a friend over for dinner the other night. For context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.\n\n\nI don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables I normally cook - pretty much all I ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.\n\n\nWell, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. We said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. We told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.\n\n\nWell, that night was meatloaf night. With homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. I offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. So, we just made him the same plate as ours. \n\n\nWell when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were PISSED. They said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? Even though it was HIS choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. Apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. Our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. Some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think I should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. I also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some I'm not going to say no. So what's reddit's judgement, who's in the wrong here?", "I have a friend, Bobby (not his real name), who struggles with his eyesight. He\u2019s quite quiet and solemn most of the time, but he\u2019s a solid guy and he\u2019s good to spend time with. We met at college a couple of years ago and have taken tons of classes together. First year we lived together, and have stayed friends since I moved out. After the first couple of weeks of knowing him, it emerged that he was registered blind. He\u2019s not completely without his sight so it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t notice this guy with a cane and a dog, it\u2019s just that he needs mega sized text to read, and he\u2019s not allowed to drive or get his license. He\u2019s completely independent though, and has a free public transport card to get the bus and train since he can\u2019t drive. He\u2019s always been a bit of a home bird as well, so every weekend he\u2019d travel  about 2 hours back up home, and 2 hours back, so that he could visit his mum and dad.\n\n\nNow my fianc\u00e9 and I have been dating for over 4 years and have been engaged for 18 months. As is the way with weddings, we sent out save the dates and invites along the way, and Bobby received both. Because I\u2019m not a very organised human, the wedding invites went out a little later than they traditionally might, but since everyone who was coming knew about the wedding in advance, and received a save the date, it was fine. We had a few people who missed the RSVP date by a couple of days but no harm no foul in my eyes. The RSVP date was set for exactly one month before the wedding. \n\n\nBackground backgrounded. Now for the potential assholery.\n\n\nBobby also missed the RSVP date. He wasn\u2019t the only one I had to chase up a week later, but he was the only one who read the message and then took two further days to reply with a yes. Today, less than two weeks before the wedding, he\u2019s messaged saying he can only come to the wedding if he can have a plus one. The reason for his plus one is his eyesight. Because he doesn\u2019t drive and he\u2019s not local he needs someone, his mum, to be present to drive him there and back. I flat out told him no, he\u2019s not inviting his mum as a plus one because we\u2019ve already told the hotel the number for the meal, but she\u2019s welcome at the rest of the day. \nThe hotel in reality doesn\u2019t need the numbers up till 48 hours before, but the table plans are set, there\u2019s no easy space to slot her in, and I don\u2019t want a friends mum that nobody knows enjoying the wedding meal and speeches, and us paying for the privilege. I now doubt whether he\u2019ll come, because I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s happy coming all the way, to not even be fed.\n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n\n\n*Edit:* A few things to update here. I\u2019ve been chatting to the friend more. Despite what you all think, I do actually care and the nuances of how much a person can see can\u2019t be put across in a AITA post. The mother is welcome at the full day, except the meal. And by the tone of Bobbys message, it wasn\u2019t Bobby asking for his mum to be there, but Bobbys overprotective mum asking that she attend. Ceremony and evening do is fine, and I told Bobby as much when he first messaged yesterday. I\u2019ve since reached out and offered to pay for the mum at the second restaurant that\u2019s on site.\n\nAdditionally, something of note is that my family are all not local. It\u2019s either a flight or a ferry for them to get to the wedding, and to cater for both my family and other guests who can\u2019t/won\u2019t drive, we hired a bus for a city centre pick-up. The bus takes people down to the church, then back to the reception venue. It\u2019s only getting home again that people need to manage themselves, but various people are staying in the same hotel that the reception is at. Travel arrangements have been a big part of the wedding, and Bobby has been invited to use them from the start.\n\nTo those saying he needs eyes for the evening. I\u2019m not disagreeing with you to be flippant of his needs, or to be callous, even if I am still an asshole. I\u2019m saying having known him for 2 years, he doesn\u2019t need his mother there. There are plenty of college friends there, who he\u2019s seated with, who can help him find his seat or point out the loos. It\u2019s a group of friends and we\u2019ve all been there to support him when necessary (which is genuinely rare, because as I said, he is *fully* independent, even in new environments).\n\nI can live with being judged an asshole, but felt there was more information available that was affecting my decision, that wasn\u2019t available to the jury.", "This actually happened about 5 months ago, but since my girlfriend (no longer engaged) refuses to let it go, and I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong, I figured I\u2019d ask for an outside opinion.\n\nMy girlfriend (then fianc\u00e9e) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago. \n\nNow, my biological mother is a useless drug addict that I\u2019ve never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. She left me with my grandma and I was raised by her since birth. I have always and will always consider my grandma my real \u201cmother\u201d  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.\n\nAbout a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. This was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn\u2019t have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer\u2019s help. She had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. \n\nFast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma\u2019s condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. My uncles and I immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. I called my fianc\u00e9e multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. Not only was I not in the best state of mind (again, she\u2019s my mother to me) but I needed to be by her side when she passed. I felt sick at the idea of not being there when I could.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted I get ready as soon as possible. She obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and I understand that it definitely sucks. She also said there was no point in me being there since she won\u2019t even know I\u2019m there due to her dementia. I understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn\u2019t matter if she realised I was there or not. I just felt I had to be there with my uncles. \n\nShe ended up passing the night of my wedding. My fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. She said I was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. She thinks that as my fianc\u00e9e she should take top priority no matter what. My opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with my grandma when she passed was more important.\n\nSo yeah that\u2019s the back story. We have both agreed to go with the majority judgement given here and move on from it. Will answer questions when possible but will refrain from defending myself in order to be fair to my GF.", "My 4 year old son Jon is the one of the twins I had. My other son was mishandled by a nurse and passed away shortly after birth, it was an unfortunate accident. \n\n\nMe and my husband left our unnamed son with the hospital and did not press charges against the nurse, much to our parents'(both his and mine) displeasure. Our reason was that we had no time nor energy to deal with them, our priority was to look after Jon, who was much smaller than his twin and needed more attention.\n\n\nWhile growing up, despite never being mentioned, Jon seemed to know that he once had a brother. He told us his made-up stories that he had about brothers, he played roles about brothers with his toys, and he even asked us to give him an older brother.\n\n\nInitially, me and my husband made a promise that we would never tell Jon about his unnamed brother, but now he wants to tell Jon about it when he is older. It must have been the guilt that we have never acknowledged our unnamed son's existence, even though they are both our sons. \n\n\nI am still still standing firm to our promise. I believe that we should not dwell on the past and move on. Jon is my son and my little bundle of joy, I would never want him to know the sorrow of losing his brother. I want to convince him that his brother is just a fragment of his imagination.\n\n\nNow both my parents, my husband's parents and my husband is calling me cold blooded. They want so much to included a deceased brother into Jon's life. He is still little, so it wouldn't be now, but they intended to tell him one day and I cannot stop them. However, I will still try to convince them while there is  time, he needs no such negativity from the past.\n\n\nAITA for thinking this way?\n\n\nEdit: Firstly I am sorry, but for anonymity purposes I omitted and changed some parts of the contents, so not all of it is real. Secondly thank you for the comments, took me a while to read it all. \n\nI am at peace now, and I will make it up to Jon.", "This couple decided to bring their son, I assume was around the age of 10 to the movies. They sat five seats down from me. I noticed during the previews a howling noise, in which I turned and saw the couple and their son, who I assume was mentally handicap by his behavior. Every five minutes, he would get up and leave the theater. When he came back, he would blurt our something loud enough for everybody to hear. This went on the ENTIRE film. It\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault, but parents should show some consideration for everybody is. ", "So we tied the knot and decided that after saying 'I do', 'Sarah' and I would each have our own digital camera to take any photos we wanted during the rest of the day to record our own personal memories, then put these in a section of our wedding photo album. It was her idea and I thought it would be fun. \n\nFast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. We look through them together for the first time- to summarise:\n\nHer photos: Me in my suit, me with our God daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. More of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me.\n\nMy photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen.\n\nAs soon as Sarah saw the pictures I had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. I asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that I hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. I basically told her that I didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. She replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. This conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. I feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, I need to know if I'm in the wrong.\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? I... feel like she's overreacting a little. I thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. I didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her.\n\n**EDIT: Info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. The cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. I remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. She prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more**\n\n**EDIT 2** I'm the asshole. And a clueless idiot. From now on I'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. Thank you to all who have judged me, I accept my judgement", "1.

Not expecting that many. \n\nIt's clearly my fault for not asking how many. At the time, I literally said I \"didn't care\" about his sperm donation and \"didn't want to know\", so I can't blame him for not telling me how many. I literally told him not to.\n\n....But 47?!

An acquaintance of mine decided to challenge this tradition because it's harmful to wildlife and is basically littering, and offered several other environmentally-friendlier options. We live in a fairly conservative area that greatly values tradition, so this was not very well received by most people.\n\nShe then created a petition/appeal to the school administration, which I signed. This was also signed by several other students and even teachers and other staff. I was also very vocal about the matter on social media. I got into a few arguments (nothing major) where I posted some statistics I had researched. I even spoke with the newspaper about the issue. \n\nYesterday, my girlfriend told me that it was embarrassing that I was supporting this, because I'm just \"stirring the pot\" and doing this for attention. She said that since the ones against it are the minority, I should just keep my mouth shut since it's not going to change (she is probably correct.) She also said she had people (both inside and outside of school) ask her why I was doing this.\n\nAITA?", "I work for a local government office, in a large complex with a whole lot of people. When their kids are sick or when they don't have a sitter for their kids, they take the day off from the substantial leave that we're allowed per year. My entitled coworker feels that when she doesn't have a sitter, it's perfectly fine to just bring her 5 year old in with her for the entire day. The kid \"camps out\" under this coworkers desk, laying on the floor, being constantly told to \"Ssssh\" and left to amuse herself with an ipad and toys. This coworker also does not ask our supervisor beforehand if it's alright to do this, she just brings the kid in. \n\nAlso, when she has her kid here, numerous people come over to our office to chat and coddle the kid and \"meet\" the kid and baby talk the kid and it's really disturbing when you're trying to concentrate on writing or creating graphics for a project. \n\nThis morning, I heard her come in and she told her kid to say hi to me. Coworkers says she didn't have a sitter today. I said, \"you mean she's here all day again?\" She said yes. I asked if she asked our supervisor if it was okay. She said, \"No, he'll know when he gets here.\" I told her that the office is NOT A DAYCARE center and she should use the leave she has to stay home and watch her kid.\nAll day she's been whispering to people about how I'm an asshole to telling her this and how I don't like kids.

I laughed along with my kid as she clearly wasn\u2019t bothered but inside I was a little WTF. \n\nI saw her at a coffee and cake morning  at school a few weeks later and she and my wife and I happened to sit on the same table. I tried to be as tactful as possible towards the end and say hey, Sophia and I kinda saw you naked a couple weeks back, maybe since you\u2019re near the school it\u2019ll be less awkward to just draw a curtain? \n\nShe was very offended and told me I was being inappropriate and I was floored.

A 478 is literally the bottom 2% of test takers. The median/average score that can maybe get you into a med school is a 500. You must score at least a 508 to be in the top 20% of applicants, in a field where only about 20% of applicants each year accepted into all the med schools in the country.\n\nResults for the June 15 exam came out yesterday. This coworker was happily telling people how she passed and got a 478. I myself aspire to be a doctor but postponed taking the MCAT because I have been unable to hit a 505 consistently in full length practice tests. I have an trying to coach her, telling her that she must hit at least a 500 to be even considered as a serious applicant. Throughout this process, I have noticed that she didn\u2019t have a solid prep plan, or a good idea of how to be a pre-med student (she is non traditional like me).\n\nSo when she was happily telling our other coworkers (and the doctors we work for!) that she got a 478, I took her aside and tried to explain to her the reality of the situation as nicely as possible. Threw in some encouraging words about the virtues of retaking, implored her to hit the Kaplan books and really research the kinds of students the schools she wants to apply to (she just wants to get in anywhere).

I know they're from her because they're things my ex would never pick out and her handwriting is on the card. \n\nThey've lived together for the last year and therefore she lives with my son half the time.

AITA for giving her the gift without asking him if it was alright first?", "This happened a couple years ago but some of our mutual friends still think I was the dick in this situation, so I thought I would submit myself to judgement.\n\nI was living with and discussing marriage with a girl I'd been dating for around 3 years.  She went off on a school trip around the end of February/beginning of March  and when she came back,  things seemed off.  It was just little things, like she started texting \"luv ya\" instead of \"love you\" and stuff like that.  I finally asked her what the deal was around the end of April, and we ended up \"taking a break\". I moved out, but we still hung out almost every day, still went on dates, still had sex. \n\nI had bought her a new cell phone around the time she got back, an LG V10 (believe it or not this is important). Around the end of May or so, the phone malfunctions and bootloops endlessly, as they are known to do.  She gives it to me so I can try to warranty it or something to get some of my money back, while she buys herself a new phone.  I did some research and discovered that the bootloop could be temporarily bypassed by freezing the phone, so I decide to give it a shot so I can try to pull her pictures and stuff off and generally just try to win some good guy points.  It works, and as soon as I boot it up she starts getting messages from \"David\". Lots of messages, of the not so innocent variety. \n\nI pop open the messages to see that they go back all the way to her school trip. She's been seeing this guy in secret for months, both before and after our \"break\" while also giving me the runaround and acting like we're on the verge of getting back together.  It's also clear that he doesn't know about me at all, every time he tries to make plans with her while we were doing somrthing, she was just making excuses like \"spending time with family\". \n\nI shoot him a few texts, tell him who I am,  that I just discovered I was being lied to, and that I suspected he was being lied to as well.  Turns out he was recently divorced because his wife had been cheating, and he was horrified to discover that he had been the \"other guy\".  Long story short, we both washed our hands of her and went our separate ways, but literally every female I know has told me that it was not my place to tell him and that I should have left well enough alone.  I even had to leave my job because the women there ostracized me so heavily because of it.  The way i see it, he deserved the truth and I helped him dodge a major bullet before it could hurt him like it hurt me.  Clearly she was the asshole for cheating, but am I the asshole for exposing it?\n\nEdit to answer some common questions:\n\n>Why did you tell everybody?\n\nI didn't.  I told one person at work, because I thought they were my friend, and who doesn't need a friend to talk to when shit like that goes down?  That one person told everyone else in the office.  We also lived in a really small town at the time, and gossipers gonna gossip.\n\n>Why are you calling her your fiancee when it sounds like you never proposed?\n\nWhen I said we discussed marriage, I meant that we had sat down and decided that we were getting marries. Plans were already in the works and a date had already been set.  I've always believed that a step that big should come from mutual agreement rather than springing it on someone and putting them on the spot for an answer. Maybe I'm wrong.\n\n>What did you do to make her cheat on you?\n\nWell, to paraphrase her reasoning, we had been together for a while and the relationship wasn't \"new and exciting\" anymore. She met a dude that made her feel the new and exciting feelings again so she decided to fuck him. Also, fuck you for asking that.", "So I have finals this week and, tensions are running high everywhere. I was studying in the library with a group of friends for a political science class, and my friend complained that this class is incredibly hard and he's having a tough time. This girl who was studying with us heard him and was like \"you aren't a STEM major so why are you even complaining? you haven't had a hard class till you've taken calc 3.\" Now I'm not a STEM major either, and I just felt tired of always being told my major isn't hard or anything, especially since she has mentioned it several times before, so I told her to shut the fuck up for once. But this led to her crying and her friends started telling me I was being mean to her.\n\nWas I the asshole here?", "Okay, so at my son's school they have a system where kids get points for good behavior and negative marks for behavior that needs work. There is an app where parents can view this as well as communicate with teachers. \n\nMy son's grade (1st) was having an end of the year good behavior field trip to a skating rink. The kids that could go had to have so many good behavior points. My son was diagnosed with ADHD and we are working on ways to help him control his energy and to behave better. That said, he was about 5 points shy of being able to go on the field trip. Because of that I did not send in a signed permission slip or money. \n\nThe day of the field trip comes around and k send my son to school expecting him to have to go to another class room for the day. After school I pick him up and ask how his day was and he proceeds to tell me that they took him with them on the field trip. He said he was told to sit at a table on the side of the skating rink and to do a work packet while watching the other kids. \n\nHe was upset because he was made to sit and watch everyone else having fun. That is understandable because these kids are 7 years old. Yes he understands consequences for bad behavior but what adult thinks this is a good consequence? So since it was after school, I messaged his teacher asking about it. I have not gotten a reply. I tried calling the principal and was unable to reach her. \n\nSo I would like to know WIBTA for calling the school board or whoever I need to call and reporting the school? I'm not talking about just reporting because they did a messed up, hurtful punishment but also because I was not made aware my son would be driven from the school for that day.", "My husband died a week ago and I'm 13 weeks pregnant. My in-laws know and they want me to keep the baby so there's a piece of him alive. When I mentioned I might get an abortion they flipped out on me, called me every name in the book and selfish, at which point I broke down in tears and left.\n\nI don't know what to do. On one hand I can understand what they mean, if I abort there's nothing of my husband left. But I just... Don't know. I can end this chapter of my life and move on. I don't know what to do. I know a lot of you are thinking it's amazing I'm pregnant and I can always have a piece of him through my baby but that's the thing, I can't decide if I want that or not. I've never been more conflicted in my life and I have to stop thinking about it so I don't miscarry from the stress.\n\nEdit: I don't know how many people will see this but I want to thank everyone who offered support and shared their stories with me via PM, I'm truly moved. I'm still undecided on what to do moving forward but I I'll try and find someone to talk to. Some more context if anyone's wondering:\n\n*  My husband died by suicide because he was too stressed out about his career. No one really saw it coming.\n*  I don't have any children, or family. My sister is the only one I know and she's on the other coast. I'm 25.\n*  I don't know if I'm going to abort, however *if* I do carry the baby full term, I'd rather take care of it myself and not give it up for adoption.\n*  I'm in New York which has some of the toughest grandparent rights laws which further complicates things. I'm afraid of giving birth then having custody taking away from me.\n*  My financial situation is... okay. I can support my baby and I if I budget down.\n*  My relationship with my in-laws was never friendly. They didn't approve of me and despite trying to warm relations with them they never reciprocated.\n*  Some people are questioning why I'm trying to move on so fast and saying I'm awful for it: The baby is growing and I can't hit pause. I need to make up my mind sooner than later.\n\n  My mind still isn't made up and likely won't be soon. I'll take some time off to think and talk to someone about this situation. Also to the very colorful PM's telling me to kill myself, go fuck yourself.

Since then, extensive clearing out has occurred at my parents house.\n\nFast forward to last month and I let my mum know that I would be needing my sketchbooks from my uni work in order to apply onto master programmes.

They've found my brothers stuff and a lot of scrappy stuff but nothing that resembles three years of university work...\n\n\nLong story short, my parents have basically lost my uni work, my application to these other universities is now compromised, mum is saying i need to sort this out myself now as she thinks I've given them a hard time\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit 1: Thankyou to everyone who had commented, I will include a bit more info below as I've seen a few re-occuring comments.\n\n1. I don't live at home, and I contacted my parents a month prior to the deadline, and kept reminding until I could get home. \n\n2. When at home I had searched the house with no luck, my parents said they had put everything in the attic for safe keeping - the attic doesn't have a drop down ladder and unless you're over 6ft like my dad, it's impossible to get inside. My work was apparently somewhere i could not physically get to. \n\n3. Im an architecture student, and whilst i do have digital presentation sheets, the emphasis of the interview is sketchbooks, hand drawn sheets and models - which i found trashed in the attic (the models). \n\n4. My parents have not apologised or spoken to me since Wednesday and my deadline is today. \n\n5. My portfolio was planned out way before the deadline, i had the sheets on photoshop set up with all the titles and annotations, all i needed was my sketchbooks, models and larger drawings to take to a plotter (i had an appointment booked) to scan and import.", "I was at baggage claim at the airport with my son, who\u2019s 3.

Our group has really huddled around her to make sure she is okay and lend our support any way we can... but... in the last few times we got together she got triggered by the graphic scenes in the films we were watching and politely asks that we stop. (The first time was Rosemary\u2019s Baby and the second was Taxi Driver, if that matters.)\n\nOf course we all wanted to be sensitive so both times we immedietly turned it off and the group quickly dispersed after (kind of a bummer). Independantly, friends from the group have asked that I not invite her the next time, because we want to watch Clockwork Orange which will definetly be triggering to her. Since I\u2019m hosting, it is up to me, but since I usually invite everyone via a group chat that she is in, it would require some maneuvering to exclude her.\n\nGod I feel like such a dick but my friends and I really want to be free to watch what we want without worrying about making her uncomfortable.

For our entire relationship, I have brought the majority of the money into the home. I contribute 75% of that. I don't mind, really. It's not something I think about and I have always considered it \"our\" money. Our country (Switzerland) is really expensive and I grew up not in a large city, and rather poor. When I had the chance to go to university, I studied hard, learned 3 languages, got 2 degrees, and was able to secure a good position in finance. Years later, I make a very good salary and we don't have to worry about money.\n\nWe decided that my husband would handle all of the money and finances for the home. I would check on the accounts every once in a while but, I haven't been checking regularly. A few weeks ago, I was thinking about buying a Model 3, since it has recently come to our country and I've fancied it for some time. I played with the numbers and while figuring out if I can afford it or not, I realized that there was a weird mistake in our accounts. There was 300k CHF/USD missing.\n\nWhen my husband got home, I showed him the accounts and after some pushing, he admitted that he lost 200k in cryptocurrency in 2018. This is about 25% of our savings. Besides being shocked and angry, I cannot help to feel that he stole from me. He put money into something stupid without talking to me and then tried to hide it. I was thinking about this for a week and talked to my friends and family about it. They think we should see a doctor and talk about it, try to work out the problem. But I honestly just want to get divorced. If he is capable of doing this, how can I trust him ever again? AITA for not wanting to talk about it or go to therapy? AITA for thinking about divorce?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To clear a few things. We always talked about where the money should go. What things to invest in, etc. I always thought he was really open about it and I trusted him... because he is my husband. I work in finance but, my husband knows just as much about personal finances as I do. After going to work every day, making more decisions about money when I came home wasn't something I wanted to do. That's why I wasn't involved but, that was a mistake. Also, he sold all of the bitcoin for a 200k loss. I don't think that was clear above. So we are not going to buy more and hope for the best like some suggested.\n\nEdit: If he had doubled our money or \"won\" in some way, would I be feeling the same way? Partially. I would be angry for him not talking about this with me. This is a large sum, too large not to discuss. I would be happy because I would have more money. Who wouldn't be happy if they had more money in their home accounts? But I would have stepped in and taken control of everything because I see all of this as gambling and that's not what I would like to do with money.", "Backstory, Im 19, 6ft1 and I use tinder frequently. I also used to be really short, like up until 17 I was sub 5ft7 and got rejected because of my height more than once. Anyway, I matched with this girl Sandy on Tinder and we started talking a bit. A few messages in she asked me how tall I was, and I pretty much instantly knew where this was going. I checked her bio and sure enough, some stupid \"5ft10+ only\" bullshit was there. Anyway, I said 6ft1, and she seemed pleased. \n\nThen I asked her how tall she was, sure enough, she was only about 5ft2, to which I basically replied mocking her for going after tall guys, and I called her a \"picky midget\", which maybe was a bit out of line. Anyway, I started goofing on her, making a bunch of jokes about footstools, and calling her out for having those preferences. Also, she isn't the thinnest girl around, not fat or whatever, but anyway, I jokingly asked her what a fat girl was doing using numbers as dealbreakers, and she called me an asshole and unmatched.\n\n I feel like a bit of a dick, but those preferences are mad dumb though, and I think she kinda had it coming.", "I\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for four years now.  I have a son from a previous relationship and she has two children of her own from her\u2019s.  My son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  Her children are 12 and 14.  \n\nPretty much since my son was born I\u2019ve put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  When I first started I was never able to add much to it, but I worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what I could.  It now has over $40k in it.  I\u2019ve been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  Still I\u2019m proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  I\u2019ve daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  \n\nMy girlfriend knew about the account. There have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  She was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   Now that my son will soon be graduating however we\u2019ve come to a point where we are unable move past.   She doesn\u2019t want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. \n\nWe are a great team usually.  It\u2019s almost unheard of for us not to be able to work through issues and come to an agreement so this is sort of new territory for us as neither is willing to budge on this issue so far.  She\u2019s fighting dirty too, she\u2019s been making it out as if I don\u2019t really love her children. At least not as much as my son.  I do love her kids.  That\u2019s not in question, but the truth is of course I love my son more.  I feel like that shouldn\u2019t even be that controversial of a thought.  I truly doubt she loves my son as much as her own children even if she\u2019d never admit it. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t even know if I would be able to split it up even if I chose too.  This is been something I broke my back over and gave up things for myself for for almost 18 years now.  Even thinking about splitting it up is difficult for me.  Inside there\u2019s just a big \u201cNO\u201d feeling that comes up when I try to consider it. \n\nI also feel like it\u2019s really shitty for my girlfriend to make this such a demand.  Putting this money aside was never easy and she had no part in that.  In fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which I now help pay off) and I don\u2019t particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money. \n\nNeither of us have been backing down and it won\u2019t be too much longer until it\u2019s time to give him the money.  ", "Edit:  Had the talk, it did not go well ha ha.  I just told her our money situation wasn\u2019t working for me anymore and we needed to figure something else out.  I told her I wanted her to starting paying for her phone, the electric, and the internet.  Combined usually around $175.   \n\nI didn\u2019t bring up her attitude from last night, but right away she knew what that was.  She said I was being stupid, petty, a bitch, and some other things that I can\u2019t really remember atm.  She said she wasn\u2019t going to pay it so I told her that if she doesn\u2019t the next time those bills come around she can find a new place to live.   More insults before she stormed out.   I haven\u2019t heard from her since.  So I\u2019m enjoying some jack and cokes and feeling pretty good about things for the first time since last night.  Cheers for all the support and advice.  I appreciate it.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGf and I live together.   She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.

Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.

Nor am I anywhere near close to being pregnant. However, my best friend is pregnant and I couldn't be more happy for her. As best friends do, we started discussing baby names. She asked me if I had any baby names picked out for my future children and I told her my mother had suggested a name years ago for my future daughter that I absolutely fell in love with. It's super unique and it's a name that originates from the country she was born in. My mother is no longer alive, so this is something I really wanted to do in the future so my potential daughter could have a connection to her grandmother. \nA few days ago, I saw on facebook that my best friend posted a picture of those 3D sonograms and in the post she revealed the name that she had picked for her daughter. It was the name I told her that I had picked out for my future daughter. I am absolutely devastated she would do this to me. She knows what that name meant to me and she decided to use it anyway. She says it's just a name and since she's pregnant before me she gets to use whatever name she wants. I told her she's being heartless and asked her how she can do this to someone she sees as a sister. She is not going to change her mind about this, so I want to end all communication with her since I can't even imagine calling her daughter by the name I wanted for mine. Am I the asshole for doing this?\n\n*Just some more information: This isn't an American/English name, it's a Middle Eastern one.

For example if I'm near a store, she'll ask me to bring her something from that store. \n\nI'm really fed up with all this drama. WIBTA if I just told her that she's the most insecure person I've ever met?\n\nEdit: I'm not going to tell her this. But as some of the comments mentioned, I'll just delete the app.", "My wife and I have been married for 12 years, and the nephew in question is my brother's oldest son, who I'll call Michael for this post. Michael is 16 and the oldest of my brother's two boys. \n\nMichael was a baby when my wife and I got together, and she has always treated him and my brother's other son like family, just the same as she treats her own siblings' kids. My wife has a significant inheritance and we both earn generous wages, and it was her idea to open college savings accounts for Michael and his brother when they were babies. This is likely to be the only family money for college they'll receive.\n\nAnyway, the story: last weekend, my brother and the boys came over for dinner and we all had a nice time, though the youngest one was on his Switch the whole time and Michael was on his phone. I didn't think anything of it until the following Tuesday, when I found my wife sobbing after work and she showed me an Instagram post made by Michael, who apparently is too stupid to realize we BOTH follow him (as do his grandparents). \n\nHe posted a picture of my wife from behind and a picture he apparently took of her underwear laid out on our bed, both mocking her size (she is overweight) and calling her a 'big bitch' among other things. My wife was devastated and humiliated and hurt, because she's always had a good relationship with him.\n\nI'm furious and want to cancel his college savings account right now, taxes be damned. My wife says she'd be too embarrassed to do this since she's an adult and shouldn't be so hurt by a child, and just wants to pretend it didn't happen. I already told his dad and let his dad deal with it at home, but I'm still furious and want to cancel the account Monday.\n\nWIBTA if I did this? Is it too much? He won't have any family money for school if I do but that isn't my problem if he comes into my home and violates my wife's privacy and disrespects her like that.\n\nEDIT: I am overwhelmed by the number of kind and thoughtful responses I received and can't reply to all of them, but I really appreciate everyone taking the time. I didn't expect the thread to blow up like this so to say it gives me a lot to think about is an understatement. I have some thinking to do and will update in a few days when I've cooled down a bit.", "I am a 35 years old guy, and I was lucky enough to marry my crush (27F) two years ago. We met at work, where she was a receptionist for the big building my company is in. Anyways, she has two daughters, 6 and 7 years old.\n\nWhen I married my wife, I was a bit iffy at the idea of being a dad so fast and so suddenly to two kids that aren\u2019t mine, but I love my wife so much I am willing to sacrifice my man-time and a portion of my salary to take care of the kids.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve had my ups and downs with them (you know, kids) and sometimes I think I\u2019d be happier going back to my \u201clone wolf\u201d life. But I fully know that this is my life now and I try my best to suck it up and do what I signed up for.\n\nBack to the story: I know the kids dad had died only from my wife\u2019s words and I\u2019ve never had reason to doubt that.\n\nIt has been two or three months since she started convincing me that I should adopt them as a birthday gift for both of them (their birthday happens in two consecutive days, coincidence). I\u2019d be fine with that, it\u2019s just paper for what I would do anyways.\n\nI agreed to that and she said she\u2019d get on with the documents. Well fantastic! I thought. I like not having to do anything. What really got me suspicious is how she changed her behaviour with her phone and laptop. She started putting the phone face down, and she created a totally different user for her laptop she switches to when she\u2019s with me.\n\nI thought she was cheating so I did what every scumbag like me would do, I spied on her. Long story short, I come to know by a very reliable source that\u2026. her ex-husband isn\u2019t paying alimony anymore as he is in jail with no money to his account. The world crushed on me. First I thought the guy was dead, now I discover he is alive, paying alimony to my wife\u2019s bank account while I was financially providing too.\n\nI confronted my wife and she didn\u2019t deny any of it. She started crying and she was adamant that she did that only for the kids\u2019 well being. She was putting the alimony money he ex was giving her into an account for when the kids will be 18 yo (I have no proof of that). She also said that it was a while since she felt I should adopt them, as they love me and they look up to me. She was firm about stating that nothing happened with her ex husband while she was with me. She said that her ex is \"dead\" for her by all means. She admitted that she lied, but for good purposes - as she was scared that a guy like me would be scared by her reckless past. That's not who she is anymore, as she is focused on family and on us.\n\nNow, I need to find out more about her ex-husband that\u2019s for sure. I am also furious with my wife for not trusting me enough to come clean about her past. Meanwhile, will I be an asshole if I refuse to adopt the kids (they have a dad and he\u2019s ALIVE!) and if I state that I will retract from them all the financial support in case I decide to get a divorce?\n\nEdit: it's child support not alimony, sorry english is not my first language.", "So this goes back almost a month now to May 19th but my wife and mom are still so furious with me that my wife may divorce me and my mom may take her side over it. I need some honest feedback to help me go forward. \n\nI'm a huge WWE fan and I pretty much get all the PPV. Money in the Bank, there was a ton I wanted to see but it also culminates several story lines into a ladder match that I really wanted to see. It was may 19th and I made it very clear I wanted to watch the event. On May 9th my wife announced that shed been invited to a coworkers wedding and I had to go with her (by a crazy coincidence that we didn't know until we got there, the grooms mom is my moms good friend). I assumed the wedding woukd be on Saturday so I agreed. Well Saturday the 18th came and went and it wasn't until the 19th when my wife was pissed I wasn't getting ready that I was like oh shit, I can't go because of rhe PPV. She got so mad at me so I relented and went. \n\nIt was one of those events where there I didn't know a single person besides my wife and my mom and rhe groom was sort of a dick. So after he sort of blew me off when I tried to congratulate him I was like fuck this and I got out my phone, parked myself in the corner and bought the PPV. My wife and now mom kept trying to get me away and be social and finally I got pissed and told them both to leave me the fuck alone. \n\nThings honest to god haven't been the same since. She says I looked like such and asshole with my phone in my face in a semi-dark room while everyone else was having fun and dancing. My mom says her friends all noticed me and commented that I must have been autistic or retarded so she's massively embarrased. \n\nTo me I had plans, I did my part to attend and when I didn't know anyone I made the best of a bad situation to do what I wanted anyways.\n\nWas I the asshole?\n\n\nedit: \n\nto address the common repeats:\n\n1. No I don't do network, my wife would come unglued if I have 24/7 access to something she hates so much. I still do PPV even though its more expensive. \n\n2. Invitation was only 10 days in advance because the bride claims she just \"forgot\" to send our invitation and only realized at the last minute when \"we\" hadn't RSVP'd. That's the bride and my wife's story, believe it if you do or don't. \n\n3. Yes it was a crazy coincidence my mom was at the wedding. But since we got a late invite and I don't speak with my mom all that often I would have no way of knowing in advance. The bride is my wife's coworker, the groom's mom is my mom' friend from some charity they work on together. I'd never met any of them. \n\nAny thing else I can clear up without having to answer over and over?", "The secrecy started early. I am a gay woman. At 15 when I came out, my mom simply disagreed. She told me I wasn't gay. She said I was jealous. That these girls looked better than me and I was jealous of them, not attracted to them. She genuinely thinks it's impossible for me to be gay and never took it seriously. It got to a point where I didn't tell her if I met anyone.\n\nSkip to when I met my wife. When I'd finally let my mom know about her(we had been together two years now) the convo went like this:\n\nMe: we want to get married.\nHer, extremely disdainful: oh you do? Well let me tell you something, throwawaygayallday, you're going to want a man. Your car breaks down, you're screwed. You need heavy stuff moved? Screwed. Two women can't make love. You're going to want a man in bed with you.\n\nI hung up on her, I was so fucking mad. I married my wife without telling my parents.\n\nI never told my mom we wanted a child and never told her of his birth. When I visited for Christmas, I went alone. I'm not sure when I planned to tell her or how. I just hadn't gotten around to doing it. Serious procrastination and dread.\n\nMy wife and I live a few hours from my parents. They've never visited(they don't know my address) and when we spend time together, I go to them. They do pass through on the way to visit other family though. They had stopped at our Wal-Mart to get last-minute items and that's when they saw us.\n\nI was there getting stuff for dinner and had my son in the cart seat. We were going down an aisle when I heard \"Hey kiddo!\" from behind. I recognized my mom's voice and turned to face her, ready to do introductions. But damn man, the instant she saw my son, she gave him the dirtiest fucking look and said \"Whose kid?\"\n\nMe, now pissed: Mine\nHer: what do you mean he's yours?\nMe: I mean he's mine\nHer: he can't be yours\nMe: ever heard of IVF?\nHer: So you went and spent god knows how much money to have a kid with your girlfriend\nMe: Wife\nHer: And when were you going to tell me about all this?\nMe: I don't know, I don't want to talk about it in the middle of the store\n\nI walked away and checked out, her following, still talking shit.\n\nI put my son and food in the car and left. My mom called later. I tried to talk to her. I apologized for the secrecy, said she gets condescending when we talk about these things. She denied this. She then went on about how I didn't invite her to the wedding, that she'll never get that moment back and see me get married(which I do feel bad about).\n\nShe eventually asked when I would bring my son over. I said never. I said I wasn't going to bring him there when she's so negative toward us. I said she doesn't respect me or my family so she doesn't deserve to know my family. Hung up on her and haven't answered her calls or texts. She has apologized for speaking to me the way she has but I don't care at this point. I'm too fucking mad. AITA for not inviting her to the wedding and not allowing her to see my son? Is \"never\" too harsh?", "For context, my wife and I have always been extremely competitive. It's an important part of our relationship, and she has gotten pissed at me in the past when she perceives I have thrown a game intentionally to spare her the sadness of losing. \n\nTonight as we were playing Scrabble, I had the option to play the word \"miscarry\" to win the game. From what I could tell, there were no other words I could've played that would have resulted in me winning.\n\nSadly, a few months she had a miscarriage. It is still a sensitive topic. I chose to play the word, and she was super upset and hurt since I had the option to play the word. She is currently not speaking to me cause I failed to immediately apologize. \n\nI think in the context of our relationship, she is overreacting. AITA here??\n\nEdit 1: I have apologized profusely, and did so pretty quickly after (just not AS I was playing the tiles). Regardless, looks like the consensus is pretty clear.. thankfully she's a very forgiving woman.", "My wife and I are both Chinese and have 3 kids together.\n\nMy kids have always looked mixed (white + Asian) and it\u2019s only become more apparent as they\u2019ve grown up. Their skin is much fairer, they have freckles (no one in our families does), there is a brown tinge to their hair. Two of my kids have brown eyes, but the youngest clearly has a mix of brown and green (I know mix isn\u2019t the right word, but it\u2019s not solid brown like 99% of Asian). They also have white looking facial features... Especially their eyes and nose.\n\nHonestly once you see it you can\u2019t unsee it and it\u2019s driving me crazy. I want to get a paternity test done behind my wife\u2019s back on the youngest (that looks the most mixed) just for piece of mind.\n\nWIBTA?

Only charged him cost of materials and shipping cost around $20. He then asked me to make another flag for a gift for his mom. I still gave it to him for cheap because growing up I was close with his family, but now he asked me to make the same flags for 5 other people in his family and one coworker. Keep in mind I sell these size flags for $150 and he assumed this time it would still be $20 each flag. I promptly told him I can\u2019t do that cost anymore, it was only really a deal for him because he is my best friend and I agreed to it the second time bc it was for his mom but now these are for people I don\u2019t even no. Told him I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s not gonna happen. He responded \u201coh, ok...\u201d and it\u2019s been weird ever since, really short. Should I have just done it and not risk ruining our friendship?\n\nUpdate: followed some advice on here and let him know I\u2019m not upset but broke down what all goes into it. Said there aren\u2019t any hard feelings but just wanted him to know why I said what I said. I\u2019ll update with his response.\n\nUpdate #2: He did give an apology of sorts. Said he thought that getting my flags out to different people would help more people see my products which could lead to more revenue. I told him I appreciate that but I currently stay busy enough without it and that I wouldn\u2019t mind giving him 50% off only bc we\u2019re boys but this would be the last time. He said he didn\u2019t mean for it to come across the way it did. Idk I still feel like it isn\u2019t resolved, we\u2019re going out for beers this weekend. Going to get him to understand my side of things.\n\nFinal update: He sent me a random message last night profusely apologizing. Apparently he was talking to his wife and she tore into him and was upset he would do that haha he just sent a PayPal payment for 5 flags at full price. Glad it all worked out, I\u2019m going to make him something customized as a thank you for the business. Thank you all for the advice. \u270c\ud83c\udffb", "When we got married, my wife and I made a deal that she gets to name our male children while I get to name the females. Our first child is a girl and I named her. Our second child is a boy, so my wife should be the one to name him. However, when she told me that she wanted to name our son Lannister after her favorite Game of Thrones family, I put my foot down.\n\nI'd have no problem if she wanted to name our dog Lannister, but this is our son. I asked her if she really wanted him to be named after a family of villains, but she just reminded me of our deal. She said she liked the Lannisters and it was her turn to name our child, so he would be named Lannister. We've had this conversation countless times and she refuses to budge.\n\nThe birth will be a C-section and I'm seriously considering filling in the paper work myself while she's still out. I know this might sound unfair to my wife given our deal, but wouldn't it be more unfair to my son if he was named after a family of power grabbing incestuous wine guzzling villains?\n\nEdit: She does not want a middle name. She wants his name to be just Lannister Ourlastname.\n\nEdit 2: The Lannister motto is 'Hear me roar'. The line 'A Lannister always pays his debts' is just a common saying.\n\nEdit 3: No, our daughter's name is not Daenerys.

My first cousin once removed (aged 18) is just about to start university after the summer. My cousin, the child's mother, just posted a long, congratulatory post on Facebook (she just had her offer bumped up to an unconditional place). In this post, she went on and on about how Child will be the first in the whole wider family to go to university. She listed off how her and her husband's parents, aunts and uncles (including my dad, the cousin's uncle) and all their kids haven't been able to attend university, and how her child will start a new generation of university attendees.\n\nI don't know whether she was playing dumb or had just had a brain fart, but she knows that both myself and my brother just graduated from university. I would have given her the benefit of the doubt for just meaning the 'adults' in the family hadn't been into further study (my dad was born 10 years after his next youngest siblings, which is why I have cousins 20ish years older than me, and a 17 year old first cousin once removed), but since she name-checked and tagged us in with everyone else, it felt like it was deliberate.\n\nI replied congratulating my second cousin, phrasing a second part of the comment as 'So great to see another [surname] starting their next stage in life, just after [brother] and I graduate from our universities!', to politely remind her that her bold claims were false. A little while later I got a message from my aunt, my cousin's mother, asking me to remove the comment since Cousin was embarrassed and felt like I was trying to one-up her (even though that's exactly what the tone of her post was).\n\nI haven't yet removed the comment, but woke up feeling pretty asshole-ish, and probably will remove the comment later on. Just how much am I in the wrong?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the advice everyone, we've had to pander to my cousin before over things, so I need to learn to stand up for myself. Also I know I messed up in correctly labelling who everyone is, the person going to university soon is my first cousin once removed, and her mum is my cousin. I also got a pronoun wrong at some point too, MY brother and I were the people who graduated a few weeks ago. Finally, to everyone saying my profile picture should be me in my gown, it already was!!\n\n2nd EDIT: I know I got the proper name for my first cousin once removed wrong!! I didn't want to change it in the post since I've seen so many times about how changing posts automatically means you're a liar and karma-seeker, but every PM saying 'just so you know...' is slowly breaking my soul! Again, apologies, family tree labels are my Achille's heel apparently!", "Today my boyfriend and 4yo daughter went to get a haircut together. My boyfriend has beautiful curls that I adore and he lets it grow pretty long. It never gets length it gets more and more curly. This time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. My daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.\n\nBf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. We weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. When my daughter saw it she giggled and said \"You look silly!\"\n\nWe were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and I told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. I told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, \"oh yeah, oopsie,\" then turned to him and said, \"I'm sorry (bf's name) I just think you look silly with no curly curls. I'm sorry for laughing.\"\n\nI thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said \"way too fucking rude, I'm going outside.\" I asked him what? but he just went outside, and I looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. He then comes back and says \"outside. now.\" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her Nintendo 2DS away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. I told him no, because she already apologized and I didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. He ended up leaving us when I went back inside.\n\nI wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. We live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. I'm 4 months pregnant and I have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when I'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. He knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. He had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, I found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. Our socks and shoes were soaked and I kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. He eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. Am I the asshole?\n\nTldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. Wanted me to give her what I think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when I didn't agree.", "*edit/info for clarification: I didn\u2019t cancel the vacation and won\u2019t. It just makes me want to not see her. \n\nI  think it\u2019s disturbing that my sister-in-law, who has a long-distance, limited relationship with our children, had their names tattooed on her arm. She did not ask us how we felt, just posted a picture on social media once it was done.\nShe has no children of her own, but is still in her child-bearing years. She is not a close beloved aunt of my children- they see her once a year and talk to her briefly on holidays. They never talk about her or ask about her between those times. They like her well enough, but she likes to lecture them and attempt to parent them, so a little of her goes a long way. \n\nShe is going to expect us to all oooh and ahh about this tattoo. I have nothing nice to say. I am not flattered, I feel violated. I feel like it glorifies tattoos (something neither I or their father have, though this isn\u2019t about tattoos in general-it\u2019s about tattoos of my kids\u2019 names. To each their own on tattoos). More importantly, it glorifies her relationship with our kids. She barely knows them, and doesn\u2019t spend time with them when we do visit. On our last visit, she sent our kids to McDonalds with her friend and didn\u2019t join them. She later used a photo the friend took of my sons eating, and posted it as if she HAD been there. It\u2019s crazy. Instead of the cost of a tattoo (this tattoo is huge BTW), how about a plane ticket to visit the children you claim to love so much? She talks about my children taking care of her when she\u2019s in a nursing home... why would they? They will be busy with their own families, and taking care of their parents!\n\nI was so mad when I saw the tattoo that I told my husband I wanted to cancel our upcoming vacation to see her (and their grandparents). I have been taking my anger out on him, which is probably unfair but I feel his lack of communication with them leads to this kind of crazy. AITA because I think tattooing my kids\u2019 names on her body is weird? Am I supposed to feel flattered?

I'm not a white guy who says \"I have lots of black friends\" because I don't, but Rob and I have been thick as thieves since we went to Jr nationals for wrestling. I literally love the guy like a brother.\n\nWe are in second semester of freshman year at our state university. Since we both hope to apply to professional grad schools, we've been searching around for community service groups in order to make contacts, get experience and maybe even help the community. We both volunteered for a veterans service organization where we go around and make sure that elderly veterans have thier basic services covered and aren't living in a dirty house. So far it's been kind of a waste of time because everyone we check has thier shit together and seem to resent us as busy bodies. Whatever, the leader of this group thinks she's saving the world and Rob and I are gong to stick it out to spring break and then find something else.\n\nSo the group had this dinner on Wednesday night at a restaurant and we went because, why not free food. I have no idea what Robs deal was but I looked across the table and Rob was cutting and eating his hamburger with a knife and fork. I about died laughing because it looked so ridiculous and I had no idea what he was doing and I've eaten meals with him thousands of times and I've never seen him do such a thing. It was hysterically funny.\n\nSo I looked at him and I said \"hey Rob are you eating your burger with a fork because you don't like black people touching your food?\"  Rob literally laughed so hard that he coughed up the piece in had in his mouth. We say stuff like this to each other all the time. \n\nBut the reaction from everyone else was the most ridiculous \"clutch the pearls\" shocked white people reaction you've ever seen. I may as well have shot Rob in the face. I was scolded by the head of of the volunteer group in person, while literally every other person present came over to Rob to make sure he was \"OK.\"  I knew I fucked up but as we were leaving we got a huge laugh about it and Rob told me that some of the cuter volunteer chicks might actually feel sorry for him enough to have sex with him. I thought it was over and done with.\n\nWell yesterday director lady sent out a group email talking about the \"horrors of racism\" and how words have power and how racism must be ripped out by its roots wherever we see it and at the end she said \"u/Monsterof will be apologizing to the entire group at Friday's meeting.\" Not apologizing to Rob who my joke was directed towards...but apparently to the group of angry white peoples who were sleepless over the mean words (not directed at them) I said to my best friend ok the planet.\n\nAgain, Rob and I got a big laugh but I'm really pissed she said I WOULD be apologizing when I hadn't even been consulted yet. I think I should just quit and leave her hanging. Rob wants me to get up there and make a mockery of her apology but I don't even want to do that. \n\nNot necessarily looking for advice because I have until 3 when the meeting starts, but am looking for am I the asshole or not?\n\n\nEdit: well group meeting came and went. They didn't want to allow Rob into the meeting to hear the apology lest he have to hear the offending words again or some such absolute horseshit, Rob's a pretty chill dude but I think that really bothered him. We didn't make a huge scene like I guess we could of, we both basically said \"no thank you\" and we'll take our services elsewhere. Rob says hello...", "So I was recently having lunch with a friend and we had decided to try a restaurant that neither of us had been to.  We had reserved a table but when we arrived, the waitress took us to a 4 person table. I told her that we only had made a reservation for 2 people, she said that this was the only table that they had available for us. \n\nThe table was a small rectangular table, with 2 chairs on each of the longer sides, with one of the shorter sides against a wall. We sat facing one another, leaving an empty chair next to us on either side. \n\nAnyway, about half way into our meal, the waitress comes up to us with 2 other people behind her and asks us if we wouldn\u2019t mind sharing our table with these 2 other people. \n\nAt first I was a bit taken aback, and really felt obliged to say \u2018yes\u2019 because she was standing there with these 2 other customers. But my thinking was that we had made a reservation, we hadn\u2019t been told that this table would require us to share, we were already into our meals and no effort was made to discreetly inform us of this request or explain the situation. So I said (as politely as possible) that we were in the middle of our meal and would prefer not to share the table. I know this was taking a stand, but my view was that she had made no effort to be fair to us in this situation so why should I bend over backwards and ruin our meal by sharing a small 4 person table with 2 other strangers.\n\nThe waitress looked at me as if I had been incredibly rude and then proceeded to apologise to the other 2 people right in front of me saying something like: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry but unfortunately they are unwilling to share their table we will have to find another place for you. I\u2019m so sorry for the inconvenience\u2019  (this was despite the fact that they had clearly heard me and were a little uncomfortable with the situation themselves). \n\nAfter this whole debacle, we were treated quite poorly by the waitress (she didn\u2019t top up the water, took a long time getting the cheque etc).\n\nAfterwards my friend told me that I should have just agreed to share the table and shouldn\u2019t have been so un-accommodating. But the way I see it, we should not have been put in this position by the waitress. If they had a policy of sharing tables (regardless of whether or not someone has made a reservation), then we should have been warned before we sat down.\n\nAm I the asshole for pushing back on the waitress\u2019 request and refusing to share our table?\n\nTLDR\nWe had a reservation for 2 people at a restaurant, but were sat at a small 4 person table when we arrived. Half way through our meal, a waitress interrupted our meal (with 2 other customers)  and asked us if we could share our table - without any explanation as to why we were being asked. I politely said that we were half way through our meal and would prefer not to share. This was not taken well by the waitress and we were treated rather coldly after this encounter.\n\nEDIT: spelling ", "We are at a Beef o' Brady's and the family next to us has 2 aged 5 to 7 children. I have 2 children myself 8 and 11. They are on games and YouTube but they are blasting it. My BF says I should just \"stay in my lane\" eat our food and go. I have no intention of being rude to them just asking if they would kind turning the phones down a bit.\n\nUpdate: So I turned to them politely and related having small kiddos needing to be occupied and asked if the volume could just be a bit lower and Dad actually made them get off them and have dinner together.

BF was irked with me initially but that's died down now also.", "My wife has gained some weight over the last year, and keeps beating herself up over it. She\u2019s always sadly talking about her sizes and calling herself too big. She lost her excitement with shopping and a few months ago I guess I made a step to change that.\n\nShe\u2019s always asking me to get things for her while she\u2019s in the dressing room, new sizes etc. She told me to get a pair of jean shorts for her in a size 6 (this size is too small for her now by a lot. She\u2019s kind of in denial about this and always asks for a size 6 and then gets very upset when it won\u2019t fit at all. She\u2019s more of a size 10 or 12 now. )\n\nI don\u2019t know... I got a bigger size and changed the sticker on the jeans so it said size 6. When it fit she was so happy and kept showing me and saying she\u2019s so proud. She said she must have lost weight but doesn\u2019t know what she did. She bought them feeling very confident with herself. When we got home, I cut the tag off the shorts. \n\nI didn\u2019t mean to but a few times after that I did it again. I guess it was part wanting to see my wife happy and part not knowing how to deal with the same meltdown happening every time. She looks really beautiful even if she gained some weight. I kept doing this and only recently did she realize that the tags on her clothes are missing. She asked me about it and I said I didn\u2019t know, maybe the store doesn\u2019t use them, but she googled the store and proved they did. \n\nI had to come clean and now she\u2019s furious. She keeps saying I\u2019m an asshole and treating her like an idiot, lied to her, stuff like that. My heart is broken too. We haven\u2019t spoken in days.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I can\u2019t believe this became so big and I feel way too overwhelmed. Hard for me not to delete the post because some people are being very cruel to me and sometimes also to my wife. Insulting her doesn\u2019t make me feel better and I don\u2019t know I feel like I understand the mistake I made but not everything I\u2019m seeing here helped me get there. Since this became so big I\u2019ll try to update what happens.", "ONE MORE EDIT: wow this got big. So we\u2019ve been doing a lot of research over night (obviously I haven\u2019t slept well) and found how non invasive the procedure could be, and the results come back in a week or so. We\u2019re gonna go to the girls parents with this information and try to explain why it\u2019s important for all of us to know. Thank you all for your input, I\u2019ll try and post an update when I know more. Also, as a side note, I wouldn\u2019t consider myself overly controlling or a \u201chelicopter parent\u201d. As I said, my son knows about safe sex, knows sex is normal, and has even asked my husband for condoms in the past, as we told him he should do whenever he needed to. The constant supervision we kept them under only applies to what happens IN OUR HOUSE, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an outlandish rule. Just because we\u2019re sex positive doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re celebratory or encouraging of it. \n\nIt\u2019s almost comical that this of all things would be what made me get a reddit account, even more comical that I\u2019m turning to the internet for input, but I just wanna put it out there that I\u2019m set in my thinking. I just wanna know if I\u2019m an asshole for it. \n\nMy 15 year old son came to my husband and I last week, telling us that his girlfriend is 7 months pregnant. As someone who became a mother very young, i am devastated and so deeply disappointed. They\u2019ve been together for about a year, but we always thought it was a kids thing, nothing harmless. Regardless, when under our watch, we kept them under CONSTANT supervision, so this was all a shock. We know the girls parents and believed we were all on the same page about our kids. \n\nTurns out we were wrong. When we called them, they spun some bullshit about how their daughter had already told us, basically placing the blame on their child for us not knowing she\u2019s been pregnant for SEVEN months. On top of this, they\u2019ve only known for about a month or two meaning she\u2019s had basically no prenatal care. \n\nWe were trying to figure out what our next steps should be, so I called my older brother. Not wanting him to keep a secret from his family, I told him I\u2019d individually call his wife and two daughters to tell them myself. When I called the youngest one, 16, who is close to my son, her first reaction was \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s even his.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing this, I immediately questioned my son, who then informed me of their very... colorful relationship. She\u2019s apparently a serial cheater, even though I didn\u2019t even think that was a factor in a 15yo\u2019s relationship. I\u2019ve never felt like such a bad mother listening to all that was going on in my sons life that I didn\u2019t know about, knowing he\u2019s never trusted me enough \n\nAfter this I contacted the parents of his girlfriend, and as gently as I could, informed them that we wanted a paternity test done. They FLIPPED, they were pissed about what I was accusing their daughter of, and saying the trauma of even bringing that up to her is too much for a heavily pregnant child. While I might agree, this is my child\u2019s life that\u2019s gonna be deeply impacted too. \n\nSo my husband and I decided we\u2019re gonna keep trying to get a paternity test done no matter what it takes. AITA for demanding this? Am I being unreasonable? As bad of a parent as I feel like I am right now for letting this happen, I feel I\u2019m no where near as bad as the girls parents...\n\nEDIT: just to clarify, weve gone over this with my son and he\u2019s on board and understands why a paternity test is important.\n\nANOTHER EDIT: We have DEFINITELY discussed safe sex with our son, as I said I was a very young mother and it was important to me to make sure they\u2019re educated. I in no way blame the girl, I just want to protect my son.", "brand new account and throwaway for you guys. \n\nSo Tuesday of last week I made my now ex-boyfriend dinner. He's a paleo junkie and I really wanted to impress him so I skipped class to slice fennel with a razor blade in order to garnish the strip steak I made for him. Yeah I really, really (really) loved him. I decided it would be easier to cook the steak in his kitchen so I went over to his place early (I have a code and open invite). I walked in to find half eaten Dominoes pizza on the counter (remember I sliced fennel with a razor blade because he's so \"dedicated\" to paleo) and noises coming from the bedroom. \n\nI walked in and he was absolutely plowing a good looking girl with a spectacular body. Fuck me for not eating pizza to impress him. I stood there in shock. She saw me over his shoulder first and started tapping furiously for him to get off. He turned around and hit me with the oh so classic \"this isn't what it looks like!\" \n\nI was speechless and had no idea what to do but I saw her clothes hanging over his desk chair. Because apparently I'm a petty b!tch, the only thing I could think was I wanted her to have leave his apartment without pants. I don't know, it made sense at the time. \n\nHe came after me begging me not to overreact, I didn't say a word and took off to my car. In the days since he's gone from begging me to \"be reasonable,\" to begging me not to break up with him and promising he'll never do it again.\n\nThe thing is, I love these jeans. Yes as a trophy of me being petty and at least ruining something of hers like she had he tag teamed to ruin my heart and self esteem. But they are also a super expensive brand, they look really good on me and I like wearing them. \n\nSo EX has gone from begging me to get back together with him to saying that me keeping the jeans is causing him \"real problems.\" I don't give a slight shit about his problems but I sort of feel bad about keeping this girl's clothes. \n\nSo I'm asking...I know I'm petty...but am I an asshole?\n\nEdit: the plot thickens, I just woke up to following text:\n\n\"hi, Alyssa. This is the weirdest text I've ever written. I'm Madison and I was the girl in Aiden's room last week. I'm so, so, so sorry, I don't know how to say it other than that. The look on your face will haunt me for the rest of my life. Please believe me when I say I didn't know he had a girlfriend. I would have never been there had I known. You have every reason not to care, but this last year has been so hard for me, my dad died of pancreatic cancer in December and I'm struggling so hard and find myself making bad choice after bad choice which I how came to be in Aiden's room. The pants you have are the ones I bought the day before my dad died, he gave me \"permission\" to go treat myself and it's the last time I ever heard him call me by his pet name as in \"pumpkin, please don't be afraid to get you want, buy your jeans.\" It would mean the world to me if you returned them to me. I know you've been hurt and I feel for you and I think Aiden is pure scum, all I want from him is getting my pants back. Please find it in your heart to return them to him or contact me directly. Thank you so much, Madison.\"\n\nSo I guess I have to give them back...I'm in tears here.\n\nEdit 2: just woke Aiden up at 5:45 (on Org Chem test day too...fuck him) with \"what's Madison's last name?\" He tried to give me the \"who's Madison?\" at first but then told him she texted me. He tried to talk me out of it but then relented so he could go back to sleep. So I looked her up on Facebook and it's pretty bare but she does have a \"instamodel\" sister who has all sorts of sad posts with like her holding her dads hand while has IV and then a somewhat touching insta memorial to her dad...so I'm thinking the text is not a lie.\n\nEdit3: I just texted back and forth with her, we\u2019re meeting at Starbucks at 9.\n\n\nEdit4: (Wednesday evening\u2014had tried to do a new post but mods suggested I just edit the op...so this is a cut and paste. Hope it makes sense I\u2019m just starting on my second bottle of skinny girl so hope this makes sense) So wow, that first post got a ton of heat and I'm so thankful, really for the chance to get some input but also because a lot of you are very, very funny and I appreciated the laughs. I don't know what the overall verdict was but I'm ok to think I was being an asshole in keeping the jeans.\n\nSo like many of you saw, the girl (Madison) texted me overnight telling me about why the jeans were important to her and asking if I would give them back. We texted back and forth a few times this morning and agreed we'd meet at the Starbucks by campus so I could return them. I got there and instantly recognized her and she got up and gave me a hug which I thought was very sweet (I'm a hugger too) and she had bought me like three different varieties of venti drinks to make sure she got one I liked (or as she admitted later, she was so nervous she didn't know what to do) which I also thought was very cool. I wasn't sure whether or not I even really wanted to talk with her but the coffee was enough entre to get me to sit down. I handed her the jeans and she was very thankful and again explained the story about her dad and teared up. Lots of people told me not to believe her but if she's lying, she's a sociopath because I could tell she was really upset by it. I did my best to comfort her which I hope was well received.\n\nSo as we got past that the only things I wanted to know were: how long had she known Aiden, did she know about me being his girlfriend and was she hoping to continue seeing him. She said they met when he and some friends went to her restaurant maybe a month ago and had been texting back and forth ever since, she said last Tuesday was the first time they'd met in person and she said she swore to god she didn't know he had a girlfriend. She said after I showed up Tuesday she was so disgusted she got dressed in her spare clothes (fat lot of good it did me to steal her jeans if my plan was to embarrass her) and left and didn't even process that her special jeans were gone until about a day later when she stared bugging him to get them back but she had no interest in seeing him. She said she was so frustrated with him stonewalling her had stopped by to get my number directly but he wouldn't even do that so she got it from his neighbor who happened to hear them arguing...she'd had my number since Sunday but was too nervous to text until yesterday.\n\nLots more happened and I can expand more in the comments but I think i'm running out of room...anyways so our plan is she is not going to tell him that I gave her the jeans back and start to demand he pay for them or buy her a new pair. When he does, she'll just give me the money or the jeans and then we'll give him the old...\"thanks for the jeans but us adults already worked it out...toodles.\" Yes we are deceiving him but we both agree he deserves it.\nLike I said lots more details but running into the 3000 character limit so I can say more if anyone is interested. Thank you for being so invested in my life. I've felt pretty rejected since this all went down and will have a hole in my heart for a long time...the kindness of internet strangers really, really helped for a few hours", "Me and my wife have been married two years. She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\nEDIT: Seems like theres a lot of confusion about my wifes faith and her relationship with her family.. Heres a story that might clear things up.\n\nMy wife and myself were at the beach. Having fun, trying to surf. She was wearing a very sexy two piece bikini. She takes selfies of herself, and posts them online where she thinks her family cant see. Harmless fun.\n\nHer brother somehow sees, and rudely tells her that shes disgracing her family. Not even kidding. I tell him to lay off her, and he threatens to attack me. Her brother is 17.\n\nThe father not only knew about this, but liked the brothers posts. Needless to say my wife ended up in tears and we haven't gone to the beach since. These are her family.\n\nEDIT 2: Post locked which is fine. Theres obviously been enough.\n\nTo all those pming saying that im a racist troll and that the mods \"exposed\" me, i messaged them and they have no evidence. That is just one mods (incorrect) opinion that they decided to sticky for whatever reason. I told them that it was causing confusion and sending harassment my way, they dont seem to care.\n\nThey also muted me for even asking so theres that.\n\nIt is simply their opinion, which is fine to have. It is nothing more than that.\n\nAs an update i realize i was over the line to lay down an ultimatum but i dont know what to do or where to go from here. Im stuck. Thats about it.", "So, to start off, maybe, it was a bit petty of me tbh. Anyway, I asked this girl Clara out on a date about a year ago. I was a completely different person then, and she turned me down. It stung like hell, but it did encourage me to better myself. Since then I've gotten in better shape, became more confident and generally I've had more luck with girls. I still never forgot what made me improve though, and that will always be a shitty memory.\n\nAnyway, me and a few friends I've made since last year went out to a gathering. I'm still fairly new in their circle, and surprise! Clara was there. I think she recognized me but I wasn't sure. Me and her hit it off, and at the end of the night we had a date planned. The date went pretty well and we went on our second one last friday.\n\nAfter this I went home and thought about where to go next, and I realized I couldn't really forgive her. So, she hit me up asking if we were going out again, and I sort of make a joke of it, blew it off and put her on mute. I haven't responded since then, and our mutual friends say she's been pretty upset, since she gets attached to people quickly, but the revenge I got was so sweet! \n\nBut, maybe I was an asshole though, what does Reddit think?", "I (17f) have been struggling with some depression after my dad passed. I spend about a year isolated, never leaving my room, just laying in bed all day miserable. I started going to therapy and working two days a week, but the moment I come home I will still crawl right into bed. I just have no energy. \n\nMy 17th birthday was a few days ago and my mom was asking if I wanted a party, she thought it would be good for me. I told her several times that no, I don't want a party, pretending to be totally fine and happy is exhausting. Especially with that many people around. \n\nBut when I came back from work and opened the door, the house was filled with people. (Maybe 10% family I'm not close to and 90% my moms friends). I didn't know what to do so I walked back out again, I grabbed a slice of pizza somewhere and walked around the park, hoping that when I came back they would be gone. \n\nWhile at the park my phone blew up with texts from my family and mom, that I was ungrateful and spoiled and didn't deserve nice things they tried to do. \n\nI came home about two hours after I left the party, my mom was super pissed. I tried to explain but she thinks it's just excuses. \n\n\nWas I the asshole? My mom is still not speaking to me, and I do feel bad that she went though all that effort for nothing.\n\n\n\nEdit: my mom and dad divorced a few years back if that matters. And I do have friends that my mom knows, but none of them were invited.\n\n\nEdit 2: \n\nI'm already in therapy and its helping.\n\n This wasn't meant as a validation post, your parent and family telling you you're wrong will make you doubt yourself. \n\nAnd I was dead on my feet, I had just worked 9 hours and I just wanted to sleep. I'm an introvert so social interactions already cost a lot of energy, so I couldn't have just 'faked in for an hour'\n\nPretending to be fine when you're not takes a lot of energy, and I couldn't at that point.\n\n\n\nEdit 3: after receiving several messages about \"using your dead daddy for attention seeking\" and the like, I'm going to log off for a while. Thank you everyone for commenting :)", "My in-laws live in a sleepy artsy fartsy town where nothing ever happens. They know all their neighbors, half of the family lives near by. They're the kind of people who are comfortable with anyone coming in or dropping by unannounced just to say hi, show someone something on their phone, etc. It's very Full House.\n\nSo that being said, they don't lock their door. We've piled into the car to go to the store or other places before and I've said \"Do you have the key?\" to be (gently, not meanly) laughed at and had it explained that they don't need to lock the door. \n\nI'm not comfortable with that, but I didn't say anything. I just moved my travel bag into my car. When we went to get ready for bed, I passed by the door and saw it hadn't been locked. I asked if I should lock up for the night and the family chuckled again. I felt extremely uncomfortable, so for peace of mind, I locked up. \n\nIn the AM, FIL got up and went to get his paper. He found the door was locked and said \"(My Name), did you lock the door?\"\n\nI said yeah, very casually. He looked at me like I was crazy. I said I'm just not comfortable with leaving doors unlocked. Both of them laughed, and for the rest of the weekend, the jokes continued. Things like \"Who hurt you?\" and \"What was so bad in your childhood that you can't deal with an unlocked door?\" and \"What do you think was going to happen, someone was going to break in? This isn't (Big City we live in).\"\n\nWe ended up leaving early because my husband was tired of telling them to knock it off. A few days later, my MIL posted what was supposed to be a funny thing  on FB and tagged me, saying \"(My Name) and Husband visited, but DIL isn't cut out for that (town) life! She couldn't handle a few unlocked doors and thinks the whole world is out to get her!\" cue the family making fun of me, my upbringing, etc.\n\nI'd finally had enough and posted back: Home invasions happen. My best friend's dad was murdered in their home by an intruder when I was 12 years old. Forgive me for caring about my safety and infringing on whatever makes you feel superior here.\"\n\nShe deleted the post and told me I was out of line, it wasn't my place to lock doors in someone's house that wasn't mine, if I didn't feel safe with them, maybe I shouldn't visit anymore. I said sure, Husband and I won't visit anymore. She backpedaled and made it clear she meant just me, but I asked why he would drive all the way out there (it's about 5 hours) without me just to be with people who were mean and judgmental about his wife and a locked fucking door? This turned into another big \"you're taking my baby away from me!\" situation.\n\nAnyway in relaying the whole story to others, I've had a surprising reaction. Am I the asshole for locking a door at night?", "I graduated college 4 years ago and I rarely speak to my mother or father. Maybe 2-3 times a year and even then it\u2019s only for a few minutes, they refused to let me play sports in high school or have a social life and they\u2019ve basically cut me out of their lives since I and about 75 other people got a city drinking ticket 7 years ago in college. Since I live about 800 miles away, I only go back to my hometown once a year either for Thanksgiving or Christmas, most years I stay with a friend or at a hotel, last year I stayed with my parents. No way in hell am I going back for either this year.\n\nJust about 5 months before I graduated college, my parents bought a boat. I know they got a good deal on it and they have used it a lot. They took it out of the water for the season in early October. I\u2019ve literally never seen it in person, just pictures from Facebook.\n\nLast week I had texted my father (first contact since March) and let him know I would be able to make it back for Christmas. About a minute later he called and over the course of 5 minutes explained how he and my mother decided since their last child was about through college, they would buy a boat. The only problem was they didn\u2019t have the ~$20,000 to buy it.\n\nWhat was their solution? Take out a student loan in my name of course! My mailing address was always their house through college so I was none the wiser. Why was my dad telling me about it now 4 years after the fact? Because they can\u2019t pay it back, they actually never paid any of it back. They kept putting it in forbearance but that ran out early this year. Fast forward 7 or 8 missed payments later and my dad tells me the only reason he\u2019s telling me now is because he doesn\u2019t want me to bring it up at Christmas and he knows it\u2019s going to default in a month or two. His exact words were \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make a big deal about this it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t come home this year\u201d.\n\nHe also said it\u2019s \u201cabout $25,000\u201d is what I would need to pay it off. I hung up and just sat in shock for a couple of minutes. I called my brother yesterday and told him what was happening and that I think I\u2019m going to sue them for whatever it takes to pay off the loan. I still don\u2019t know what that amount is yet, I should probably find out by next week. I\u2019m cool with my brother and he\u2019s cool with my parents and I\u2019m sure he probably talked to them because this morning I get a text from my mom just saying \u201cDo NOT sue us\u201d. I texted her back saying she would need to immediately pay off the entire loan and show me proof. She texts back that I need to grow up. Obviously I\u2019m not even going to respond to that.\n\nThe boat is probably worth half of what they paid for it by now and with the hours they\u2019ve put on it. I don\u2019t know if they have the money or not to pay up immediately if I sue them but I figure I can at least garnish their wages. My other brother called and asked me to hold off a few months before doing anything that it was shitty of them to do that but to give them a chance to start paying if off.\n", "My husband and I are having a baby. I'm mixed race, half black and half white. My husband is black. \n\nWe don't know the gender yet but my husband prefers names that most people would call black names for boys. Names like Trayvon, DeVonte, Marquis, etc. \n\nI grew up with a name that is tied to black culture and hated it for most of my life. I go by a shortened form of my name professionally (i.e Dee for Denaisha) because I have seen how people react to my government name. I am sure I have been passed up for jobs because of how people perceive my name. \n\nMy husband has a name more commonly used for white boys (i.e Jake). He wants a strong black name for our son because he never had that and believes that giving him a \"white\" name to avoid racism isn't helping anyone. I don't disagree but don't want to use our son as a test dummy to change that. \n\nThis has become a battle. I know that we both need to agree on a baby name but AITA for writing off all black names?", "Two nights ago I was out for dinner with my husband at this new restaurant we\u2019ve been wanting to try for a while. It\u2019s got a Michelin star so it\u2019s always packed and the restaurant itself is pretty tiny and spans two floors. \n\nWe got a great table on the first floor which is really just a bar, some tiny two person tables, and those standing tables for drinks. We essentially got the only table by the window for actual dining. We got this due to calling nearly a week ahead for reservations. \n\nAnyways nearly half an hour into our meal this visibly pregnant woman and her husband comes in asking for a table. They had a reservation but no request for any specific table so when the hostess starts leading them upstairs to the main dining room the woman says no, she can\u2019t go up stairs in her current state (she looks VERY pregnant). \n\nLong story short, they end up approaching us asking if we\u2019d mind switching tables with them so they could have our ground floor table. My husband is like ok I guess but I simply said no, I called ahead to get this exact table and I want to stay here. The hostess shrugs and the woman and her husband looks pretty ticked off. She rolled her eyes at me and they just left. My husband thinks we should\u2019ve given up our table. AITA?\n\n**Edit**: To everyone asking for more details, here\u2019s a better breakdown of what happened. \n\nWe had just gotten our starters and were still anticipating 3 more courses (pasta/main/dessert). We had also ordered an expensive bottle of wine so had no intention to rush the evening. The table I reserved was a bit special because it was the only one set in these huge bay windows that\u2019s very iconic to this particular restaurant, looks very romantic basically. I had called previously just to ask for this table and was turned down (original date was last weekend but table was taken) but we went midweek instead since we weren\u2019t in any rush and thought that window table was especially nice. Also the upstairs dining room is sort of grim compared to downstairs (smaller windows, used to be the attic). \n\nWhen the other couple came in we didn\u2019t notice initially until they started whispering to each other and the hostess while staring at us. Eventually the hostess comes over with them in tow asking if we\u2019d switch tables and they\u2019d comp our starters. The pregnant woman tells us they drove over an hour to get here to eat and she can\u2019t walk up stairs because of her knees (it was some medical condition I can\u2019t remember). My husband and I talked it over and I said no thank you we\u2019d like the stay here if possible. Honestly I didn\u2019t expect them to just leave the restaurant. I assumed they would make do and just eat at the other smaller bar tables on the ground floor since they were mostly empty at this time.\n\nThis is where the couple kind of huffs collectively and the guy said \u201cseriously?\u201d under his breath and the woman very exaggeratedly rolled her eyes. I\u2019m like \u201cwhatever\u201d at this point and we go back to our meal. Some waiters come over and offer to piece together some of the smaller bar tables on the ground floor into one large table but I guess they didn\u2019t want that (we weren\u2019t close enough to hear why). Finally our waitress and hostess comes over (couple waits by door) asking if we can finish in ~30 minutes if they rush our order and bring all the food out at once. My husband and I are like \u201cobviously not we\u2019re not going to glug our wine and inhale our food\u201d and they relent and go tell the couple we\u2019re not moving. Then the couple leaves.\n\nActually, looking back now it\u2019s possible that couple knew people at this restaurant since the hostess/waiters seemed exceptionally frantic when they couldn\u2019t get our table and kept apologizing. I remember being kind of annoyed they were acting like that when they basically wanted to kick us out minutes earlier. Could be speculation but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they were important somehow and the restaurant didn\u2019t want to piss them off.", "Throwaway because some of my friends have reddit too. \n\n\nTo start my story off, let me give you some background info. I am a woman. My husband is a bisexual male leaning more towards straight, but is still bi. We have only recently gotten married, about 9 months ago. Before that we dated for a couple of years. My husband has always wanted to have a threesome with another bi man, as he could please both of us. I wasn\u2019t too comfortable with doing this, but last week, I finally agreed. My husband is very in with the lgbtq+ community in our area, so he knew exactly who he wanted to join us right away. We scheduled to have this event partake three days after my agreeing at the friends house, who we will call jim.\n\n\nNow fast forward to four days ago, the day of the threesome. I was very nervous, but my husband was excited to \u201c finally be able to have a good man in him\u201d as he said. We got to jim\u2019s house, and were brought inside. We had a few drink and then started. I don\u2019t want to make this too NSFW but what i will say was that both of them were involved with each other and me in multiple ways. But I guess my husband wanting for men was more than i expected, because after a few minute of foreplay and intercourse, it turned into my husband and jim just having normal sex. I saw what was happening, grabbed my clothes, ran out the house and into my car, and drove away almost in tears. Some people might see this as an overreaction, but in my mind, all my husband was doing was cheating on me with another man. I later texted him and told him he could stay at jim\u2019s house overnight, he wasn\u2019t welcome here. Later the next day jim dropped my husband off, who was not apologetic at all. He was mad at me for driving away, saying that he did nothing wrong, and that he just wanted to satisfy his needs. Most of our other friends also sided with him, saying that he needs a man every now and then.\n\n\nSo what do you think reddit, AITA for having a \u201cthreesome\u201d with my husband and his friend?\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, we are no way at all in an open relationship.", "For background I am a 22 year old woman from a large Middle Eastern nation. In my culture arranged marriages are quite common amongst the religious population.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI attend a prestigious private university in one of the most populous cities in our region of the world. My family is very well off as my father is the CEO of one of the most successful holdings in our nation. I am studying engineering and in my faculty there is a man who I will refer to as Ali. Ali is Syrian and sought refuge in our country. He came here with his two young sisters and his mother. His father passed away in the Syrian war. His family currently lives in a small single bedroom apartment and are supported by my countries government aid. He has a sponsor so he can attend my University.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAli and I are both studying Civil Engineering. I have been in love with him since grade 1 of University. The problem is he has deep feelings for a Syrian girl who also ran away to my country. She doesn't want to be with him as far as I know. Since we are nearing graduation, I want to tell him that if he lets her go and chooses to start a relationship with me then him and his family would be financially secure for life. I want to propose this idea to him and his mother. I am not technically persuading him to marry me, but if he does he would be saving his family from ever having to go back to Syria. And he would know this. AITA for making this offer?\n\nEdit: for everyone begging to know my nationality, I won\u2019t reveal this however I will say that I am NOT Arab.\n\nEDIT 2: Believe it or not I read every single response (admittedly skimmed through most). I made my decision though. I'm going to talk it out with my father. Either way whatever ends up happening I will post an update. Thanks everyone!", "I got an email that \u201cmy\u201d account name had been changed. Since I didn\u2019t have an account under the supposed name I checked it out. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t my account so I dm\u2019ed the other person, \u201cHi it\u2019s actually [name]. Do you want to change your email?\u201d To which he responded, \u201cNo I\u2019m also actually [name] bitch.\u201d\n\nNow this user appeared to be a kid so I decided to use this as a learning opportunity. I changed his password and deleted his recovery phone number. I then gave him a bio which said, \u201cdm me @[my account] with your email so I can change it for you.\u201d", "We are from the Philippines and my mom is extremely religious. I am a closeted atheist since I was about 13. My mom had quite a tough-ish life due to (mostly) her bad decisions like not being good with money, refusing every good opportunity that came her way because she believed in \"signs from God\" (e.g. someone offered her a substantial amount of money for something she wasn't selling, she prayed and asked God \"if this is a bad decision, let person x come by my house this week\" but person x comes by our house 2-3x a week. While I told her it's a very good decision to sell, since person x comes by ANYWAY she follows her \"sign\"). She's a single mom and I am her only child. So I always dreamt of giving her a good life.\n\nI learned to not follow her mistakes, and I suppose this is why I became an atheist. I worked extremely hard because I wanted a different life from that of my mom. 25 yrs later, I became quite successful. Bought her a house, a car and an allowance each month. \n\nShe never once thanked me. Instead, she thanked God. I ignored this at first, but then she got quite extreme. I mentioned to her that I did work pretty hard to get here, and she says things like \"This is God's reward to me, all those years of following him. I deserve/earned this\" and \"It was through my prayers and faith that He listened and gave you the strength to push through. If you think this was purely because of you, you are sorely mistaken!\"\n\nI am going to Australia for a holiday, I wanted to take her and she said something like \"praise be to Him! He loves me so much, he knew I deserve to have a vacation!\" I don't know why, but it rubbed me the wrong way and told her \"nevermind, I'm going alone.\" \n\nShe's upset, asked why and I said that I am so sick and tired of hearing her praise some Being for my hard work and love. She said I am being ungrateful and delusional if I think my success was because of \"just me working hard\"", "I truly want an honest opinion so I'm going to include all details I can w/in char limit, even ones that aren't flattering to me. \n\nI've been dating my GF for about a month. honestly I feel much stronger about her than she does me, but I'm hoping she comes around. She is on our university gymnastics team and is an incredible athlete. I went to her meet this afternoon and was freaking shocked to see how much of her floor routine had \"sexual\" elements. She did her routine to \"p'on da replay\" and as an example she crawled on all fours, she shook her ass, she did this thing where she went up and down her body with her finger (including her breasts) and then acted like her finger was sizzling. And during all this, her teammates cheered. I was blown away that this sort of sexuality was not only allowed but encouraged. \n\nAfter the meet I told her I didn't think she should do that sort of stuff. She told me that it was normal for gymnastics and that her routine had been worked out for years with coaches and choreographers. I told her it was normal for strippers who danced for dollar bills. She told me I didn't get it. I told her that I didn't understand what was to get, I was her boyfriend and it was my job to look out for her. She told me \"you are literally and asshole and way overstepping your bounds!\" I told her that I didn't want to fight and she said it was too late. So instead of her going on a romantic date I had planned, she decided to hang out with her teammates. I am so upset because I was counting on seeing her tonight. \n\nBased on what she said, am I the asshole for thinking her routine should be less sexy and telling her so?", "I feel like I was in the right but my aunt, three of my siblings think I\u2019m an asshole. I\u2019m 31 and a female and I\u2019m the oldest of ten kids my parents had me at 15,16 respectively. They both dropped out of high school and they got married when my mom was 17. My dad joined the military and they had my next sibling on my moms 18th birthday. My brother is 28, the other kids range in age from 10-27. I grew up taking care of my siblings, my mom and dad expected me to basically help raise their younger kids. Because of this I have no interest in having kids myself. My 23 year old sister pretty much took over my role and still lives at home. \n\nMy mom is 46 she homeschools the 10,12,14, and 17 year olds. She has never worked although she doesn\u2019t do chores or clean the kids chores cover that. Her and my dad bought a fixer upper he planned on fixing up when he retires in a few years, they plan on turning into an organic farm.\n\nHowever now that\u2019s all up in the air as my mom just announced this weekend she is pregnant again. She thought she was suffering from pre menopause..nope she\u2019s pregnant. Thing is she also admitted she had not been taking her BC for the last year and had hoped to have one more child. \n\nI lost my cool because my dad has a bad back and he should have retired this year. Now with the new baby he is saying he may have to work another ten years. I told my mom she\u2019s disgusting for doing that, and she had ten kids that\u2019s plenty enough \n\n\nShe burst into tears and ran out of the room, my dad told me to leave unless I was going to apologize and my 20 year old brother and 23,25 year old sisters told me I was an asshole. \n\nMy 28 year old brother and my gf said I maybe could have said it nicer but they think it\u2019s messed up. \n\nSo reddit was I the asshole?", "I'm getting a major surgery done in about three weeks and I was told there's a 60-80% chance it will kill me. It's 60% if I do all the things the surgeon told me to do to prepare for the surgery (take supplements, gain weight fast, lots of protein) and I'm following all the rules. So let's say my chances of dying are 60%. That's not great but not too horrible.\n\nThe thing is that I've had this exact surgery before and I came out just fine so my family has no reason to think this time will be any different (aside from the risk involved with any surgery). However for reasons involving My Medical Condition (TM), this time the surgery is riskier.\n\nMy family consists of my older brother (28M) who I (27M) live with and my mom (54F) who lives on the other side of the country. My brother is very protective of me and my mom still acts like I'm her little boy. The only reasons I could think of to tell them would be:\n\n1. Give them time to prepare for the possibility of my death. BUT I don't think this is something they can prepare for. I'm sure they'd just be miserable for the time leading up to the surgery. I don't want that.\n2. Give us all a chance to make happy memories before the surgery. Again I don't think that can happen when we'd only be doing it because I might die soon. It would feel forced and desperate and they would only be pretending to not be miserable and I'd be unhappy because I would know they're miserable.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"ignorance is bliss\" for everyone involved. If I survive, no harm done and all that potential misery would be for nothing. If I die, well that's a risk of any surgery and their final moments with me wouldn't have had that misery. And with My Medical Condition (TM) it's unlikely I'd make it to retirement age anyway.\n\nBut is it right for me to hide something this big, even if it's to spare them pain? What are your thoughts?\n\nEDIT: The surgery is 100% necessary. I WILL die without it, but it would take maybe a year or so and be very unpleasant.\n\nEdit2: I've already gone over how I'd want my body dealt with the last time I had surgery (donated to science or cremated if science doesn't want it). I have no debts and my brother knows about all my bank accounts.\n\nEdit3: I will write letters to them.\n\nEdit4: Maybe I wasn't very clear about this because a few people have commented about it. I'm not hiding the surgery itself from my family, just how risky it is. They're going to come see me off and we'll say our I love yous and good lucks at the hospital.\n\nEdit5: I already have an advanced medical directive from the last time I had this surgery.\n\nAnd YES I promise to post an update if I survive! You're all very sweet for wishing me well. It turns out Reddit isn't as scary as I feared (I just joined and this is my first post).\n\nEdit6: Thanks to everyone who responded with their thoughts! I honestly don't know what I want anymore. There seems to be no good answer and spending the last 4 hours reading what everyone has said and thinking about my upcoming surgery has left me feeling pretty drained. I'm going to take a break and recharge.\n\nEDIT7: Okay I'm feeling very overwhelmed here. I was only expecting to get 10 comments, maybe 20 at the most. Now there's nearly 400 comments. I wrote this post feeling pretty confident of my decision but I wanted to see if anyone out there had a different perspective, another point of view that I hadn't considered. After reading over 100 of these comments I don't know what I should do anymore. I'm feeling guilty for hiding this but I can't see what the right thing to do is. There probably *isn't* a right thing to do.\n\nSo many of you have shared their stories and experiences with the death of a loved one. I'm truly sorry you had to go through that and I appreciate your perspectives. I'm going to revisit this in the morning and look at this with fresh eyes.\n\nPS: To all the people who are setting reminders for three weeks (a bit morbid but I understand) you should make it for four weeks. If I survive, I'll need time to recover and get out of the ICU before I come back to Reddit.", "Yesterday I treated myself to the movies & wine and decided taking a Lyft would be the safest way home. \n\nThe driver was chatty. I asked him about the house music he was playing because I liked it too, in hopes he would crank it up. Instead, he began asking me what movie I saw, kept bringing up my \u2018boyfriend\u2019, asking me if I liked girls and so on.\n\nI found this topic of discussion inappropriate & honestly I didn\u2019t even want to talk in the first place, but since I was in a locked car with a stranger, I responded casually that I\u2019m not interested in anything & that I enjoy time by myself. \n\nThat did not deter him from asking me out right as I was going to exit the car. I reminded him that I prefer to be alone and left.\n\nPart of me says reporting him would make the ride more comfortable for other girls & also appropriate for my level of discomfort but another says that this man made an error of judgment and I should just give him a lower rating instead.\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for all your thoughtful responses. I sent the report in and quickly received a message from Lyft expressing concern and interest in resolving the issue. Do I want him fired? No, hence this post. I just want him to be reminded on how to prioritize the experience the customer is paying for.\n\nEDIT 2: This is my final say on the matter. This was not a flattering event for me. My ride was uncomfortable due to the driver\u2019s lack of awareness & decorum. I too, work at a job where ratings matter. I do my very best to make sure that my customers feel safe and comfortable. I was a captive audience the whole car ride, and that was taken advantage of. \n\nI did not expect this post to blow up, but since it did, please read these responses with empathy and learn something today. Thank you.", "Long story short, my mum was abusive growing up which led to me cutting contact the second I left home. The main form of abuse was saying I'd never amount to anything, was retarded, work at mcdonalds despite loads of evidence on the contrary.

We haven't met in person yet but have spoke over the phone where she seemed nicer than she used to be, but I insisted she called me \"dr \\[my name\\]\" or i wasn't speaking to her. At first she thought I was joking so I hung up and rejected her calls for a few weeks, and from then on she has used it.\n\nMy brother (mum was far nicer to him) has complained to me that I'm being a massive bell-end. To be honest I'm barely willing to speak to her, and not bothering at all unless she shows proper respect. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sure it's going to get asked and no, I don't insist on being called dr outside of work, ever. At work I don't care either and although many people do call me dr, I don't expect it or get offended by its absence.\n\nWell this blew up.

Anyway peace out.", "Pretty much says it in the title; whenever I initiate sex with my gf she winces in pain and says it's uncomfortable. Yet whenever she is up for it there seems to be no pain issue at all. \n\nLast night we were fooling around and I got her to orgasm through foreplay - zero issues or pain. I was pretty into it and initiated sex and instantly she was uncomfortable, despite me slowing down the pace. Finally after one thrust she yelled out in pain pretty much directly in my face which was the final straw for me. This has been happening for so long now yet she never does anything about it and tbh I doubt there is any pain - and if there is then she seems to be exaggerating it way out of proportion. I know that people will say no vagina, no opinion; but I know for a fact that I wasn't being forceful or rough so to downright scream in my face was totally unnecessary. \n\nShe has no other symptoms or discomfort aside from this, and like I said if she initiates then miraculously there's no problem. It's not a lube thing either, trust me I've tried that too. \n\nI guess the reason I'm asking is because last night we kinda had a big fight about it. I lost my cool and told her how huge a turn off it is to see her face screwed up in pain all the time, and how I didnt think the pain was as bad as she was making out. I told her that sex was becoming really boring and I could pretty much predict how it would go each time. I also said the only solution  at this point was just to not have sex. She called me an asshole and went on the offensive. Said I have two moves and yet I expect her to be like a 'porn star'. \n\nSo am I the asshole? Or should there be more give and take in this scenario? Can I insist she gets a medical check?\n\n**TL;DR: girlfriend is in apparent pain any time I want to have sex, but is fine when she's the initiator.

The higher ranking people in my husband\u2019s chain of command are really thankful that the report was made. The lower ranking ones (my husband\u2019s peers) are pretty livid and any thanksgiving or Christmas plans made with my family have been taken back.

My husband has calmed down but he has barely spoken to me and has been sleeping on the couch.\n\nI\u2019ve deleted all my social media accounts for now just because I\u2019m tired of being in the middle of this.

I finished my shift and come home around 11pm (I work at a restaurant) and I just wanted to shower. Everyone had already been partying for hours by now. The baby started to cry and the couple insisted they needed to go. I offered to get them an uber or they could have the pull out couch or even our bed. I tried to get an uber through the app but my husband told me I needed to stop nagging and leave them alone. It\u2019s not easy trying to convince a drunk person to stay if they insist on leaving.\n\nNo it didn\u2019t occur to me to slash their tires or break their car battery.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about calling their command. My husband is a first year in the military and graduated boot camp earlier this year.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to exaggerate how drunk they were, when I tried to get them to stay I could hardly make out what they were trying to say besides \u201cshe needs her crib\u201d and \u201cour house is right there!\u201d \n\nTo answer how they knew it was me, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve tried to keep people from leaving a party before. There is a group text everyone is in and they asked me straight up if I made the call. I said I did. I didn\u2019t want to lie about it.", "**UPDATE [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/user/confusedbfthrowaway1/comments/bgi725/update_aita_for_not_being_able_to_accept_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) BC I'M APPARENTLY NOT ALLOWED TO POST THEM HERE**\n\nI know how the title of this sounds but please hear me out. Also, this is a throwaway bc I'm pretty sure my partner knows my main account and I don't want her to see this. \n\nAbout a year ago my (20M) partner (25F) came out to me as polyamorous, and told me that she'd like to begin having sexual relationships with other men. She told me that, for her, it's not a case of wanting to date other people but more to make our relationship an open one where she's free to sleep with others if she wants too. I'm by no means an old fashioned dude - hell I even suggested we try out three ways for this, which she said wasn't the same - but I'm pretty into monogamy and told her that I wasn't necessarily comfortable with the idea of her sleeping with other guys. Note: I'm not judging anyone who *is* into this type of relationship, just that it isn't at all for me.\n\nLong story short, she got absolutely hysterical about the fact that I told her I was uncomfortable with it, told me how depressed she was not being able to explore her sexuality to the fullest and pointing out how supportive she was of me when I came out as bisexual. I eventually caved and told her okay, but on the conditions that a) she doesn't bring anyone else into our bed and b) I don't have to hear about it in detail. She agreed and got on with finding other guys pretty quickly. She became noticeably happier after she started this, so I've just been kinda grinning and bearing it. \n\nThing is, she's seemingly become completely disinterested in having a physical relationship with me since she started them with other dudes. I'm not someone who's asking for sex every single night, but at this point I'm lucky if we do it once a month and she never wants to be casually affectionate with me any more. It's gotten to the point where our five year old daughter has noticed, and has asked me why mummy doesn't kiss me goodbye when she goes out any more. It feels like we're just mates who share a bed. Conversely, she's going to meet other guys at least once a week and I'm fairly sure she's sleeping with them at least half the time. \n\nI brought my concerns up to her and she got upset again, saying I had no right to be mad bc she was sticking to my terms and that I was trying to police her sexuality. I'm now in a place where I'm completely torn. As I said, she's noticeably happier when she's exploring her sexuality to the fullest and of course I want her to be happy. And she really was very supportive of me when I came out as bi. But it's really killing me that she seems to not want anything to do with me intimately any more. I get that these guys are probably older and more experienced than I am, but it bums me out that I'm not enough for her. \n\nSo what do y'all think? Am I being an arsehole and should I just get over myself and try to learn to accept her more? Or am I justified in being upset?\n\nETA: made a comment saying this but people are still asking so I'll post an explanation about how I'm 20 with a 5 year old daughter. When I was a teen I was in a very violent and toxic environment at home. A dude in our building who I would petsit for took pity on me when things got real bad at home and would let me crash on his couch if I needed to get out of my parents' place for a night or two. My now gf was his flatmate and made it apparent she was interested in me, thinking I was ~17 (age of consent in the UK is 16). I didn't turn down her advances because I was a dumb 15 year old who thought banging a hot 20 year old chick would be peak cool. Clearly in retrospect this wasn't a good idea, and no she didn't back off when she realised she was wrong about my age (obviously), but that's how that went down for everyone who's curious.", "I was part of a meals on wheels program for community service in high school and met this wonderfully sweet old woman who didn\u2019t have any family nearby. \n\nWe had a lot in common, I had been considering a career in social work, she didn\u2019t have any family nearby, and I didn\u2019t have any living grandmothers so we became fast friends. \n\nShe developed dementia and towards the end I basically moved in with her and cared for her in exchange for free rent in her home and groceries. (It was also out of my love for her, but I couldn\u2019t have afforded to care for her full time if I also had to make rent.) \n\nShe died and it was heartbreaking but I also saw firsthand how she was suffering in the final days, so it was bittersweet. \n\nShe divided her will among her children and I equally. I did not ask her to do this, I never asked her about the contents of her will and the one time we briefly discussed it all we discussed was the house, not her savings. \n\nShe left me 80k and change, and the same amount to her two children. A remarkable gesture and life changing for me, obviously. \n\nHer children are contesting the will because she apparently added me in around the same time her dementia began to rear it\u2019s ugly head. They insist she was confused and had mistakenly come to believe I was one of her children and that even if she hadn\u2019t mistaken me to be one of her children, that she was not in her right mind when she did this so the will should be invalid. \n\nI am very conflicted as to my responsibility here.  I would obviously very much like to keep the money but I don\u2019t want to let how life changing the money would be cloud my judgment. I don\u2019t need it so badly that it would be worth doing wrong by her or her kids. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the considerate opinions, it is going a long way in helping me process my role in all this.\n\nEdit: Comment with full timeline of our relationship. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cxsymc/aita_for_letting_a_dementia_patient_add_me_to_her/eyomkvs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app", "So like 3 months ago when I was looking for a job my cousin suggested I work at the restaurant she works at. At the time I was like yeah that sounds cool, but had also just started working for doordash just to have income. However I actually enjoy doordash and delivering, plus I like the flexibility. So the place my cousin works at never called or replied to my resumes. \n\nHowever I just ran into her yesterday, 3 months later and after talking to her for a few minutes   (we ran into each other when she was walking into work) she said she\u2019d tell them about me again. So she calls me yesterday and said they want me to interview today. I really had put no thought into taking the job or a new one at that cus I\u2019m content with what I\u2019m doing now. However I spontaneously said yes. But now the interview is in an hour and I honestly don\u2019t want to go. But my cousin gave me a reference and said she\u2019s excited to work with me but I just don\u2019t know how to feel or what to do. Truth is I really am not looking for another job and one has just been sprung upon me. I know I accepted the interview but, idk....\n\nEdit: I\u2019m on my way to the interview now. I know for my cousins reputation the least I can do is show up. I\u2019m just going to wing it and give it some more thought so if they call back and offer the job I\u2019ll have a more thought out answer\n\nEdit 2: the manager is 20 minutes late to the interview now\n\nEdit 3: actually glad I went because the reason I was hesitant was because i thought they\u2019d be hiring me as a host. However they said they\u2019re looking for delivery and were interested in my doordash experience and said they\u2019d cover mileage, include tips, and guarantee pay if there are no deliveries. That\u2019s more than I have with doordash so I actually am interested in this position now. They set me up for another interview. Thank you to everyone here who called me an asshole and made me feel bad so I\u2019d get my ass to the interview. Actually worked out in my favor.\n\nlast edit: it was definitely an interesting day. Initially when I posted this, within the first 3 minutes about 5 people said I was the asshole. That made me feel pretty bad so I went to go to the interview 10 minutes after posting. Edit 1 occurred 10 minutes after the post, edit 2 about 20-30 minutes after edit1, then edit3 about 45 minutes after. Glad you all enjoyed the read.", "My husband and I have been married for almost two decades. We have a daughter who is my favorite person on this earth. She is so fantastic. She will be starting her senior year of high school and is preparing to apply for colleges.\n\nI was contacted recently by another woman, who informed me that my husband had an affair with her, and when she found out about me, he arranged to pay child support for their child under the table so that I wouldn't find out. She sent me a number of documents recording bank transfers, which I was able to match to transfers from our accounts, as well as photos of my husband with their child through the years. She also provided the dates of his visits to her, which line up with several of his business trips. \n\nI was totally devastated and took the time to think it over and verify everything before I confronted my husband. I have decided that I am going to wait a year until I tell him that I know and file for divorce. It will be a terrible year for me but I know I can fake it since he's traveling for work a lot anyway. I have decided to do this for several reasons:\n\n1. Our daughter will be applying to college soon and will be starting a really important year. I don't want to blow her life up with a divorce and the bombshell that her father was unfaithful and now she has a sibling that neither of us knew about. \n2. My husband has many more financial resources than I do. I am well aware that if I file for divorce while our daughter still lives at home, he will leave me to care for her and will make me fight tooth and nail for monetary support and will likely drain me with legal fees, as he tends to be litigious. I make enough to support myself comfortably, but not enough to comfortably support myself and my daughter.\n3. I fear that opening this door will open others. That is, I worry that he may have other children that I don't know about, which would only magnify the hurt for both me and my daughter, and I don't think that now is the time to handle it.\n\nMy question is, does my plan make me an asshole? I feel slimy not telling him right now and faking my affection for him, but I fear for my daughter's wellbeing and my own ability to support us. AITA?\n\nEdit: just wanted to add that my daughter will be 18 in September, so child support for the next year isn\u2019t as cut and dry", "I\u2019ll just get right into it. My aunt had been staying with us for 4 months. We never saw her  often because she lives on the other side of the country but my mom took her in after a horrible divorce. I immediately noticed that she was acting a little weird/loony but I attributed that to having gone through so much with her husband. My brother (who\u2019s 20) seemed to make a lot of effort to spend time with her but I didn\u2019t think anything of it because why would I? \n\nI came back early from work one day and heard really loud noises. The more I listened, the more I realized someone was definitely having sex. I instantly thought that my brother brought a girl home or something because the noises came from his room. His door was somewhat open so I rushed past it to get to mine only to be stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the back of my aunt, clear as day. I instantly felt like throwing up and managed to get to my room without them seeing me. In there I pretty much collapsed, contemplated my existence and the utter fucked-up-ness of my family (I knew it was fucked up, but not like this) Then I just felt scared. I didn\u2019t know what it meant. I knew it was wrong, very wrong, but not what to do about it. I was also honestly super scared for their well being, especially my brother who had already been abused by my cousin as a kid (my aunt and mother were also abused by my uncles. This what I meant by fucked up family). I just kind of panicked. \n\nSo the next day, my aunt went to work and I knew she would be there late. When my mom came home, I instantly told her I needed to tell her something. I sat her down and told her exactly what I saw and heard and she went BALLISTIC. She stormed to her car and drove to my aunts job. My aunt never came back. \n\nMy brother is now very upset with me. He told me that they\u2019re two consenting adults and can do whatever they want and that they weren\u2019t hurting anybody and that it was never my business. He has all of his stuff packed and he\u2019s planning on driving across the country to be with her tonight. My mom is still livid about it and told every single one of my family members. They all HATE my aunt now and want nothing to do with her. This made me feel guilty because they used to absolutely adore her. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck wondering if I made an asshole move by \u201ctelling\u201d on them. My family is a mess, my mom who already had issues has seemingly gone off the rails, my aunt is all on her own and my brother might never forgive me.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: My brother left late last night/early this morning to be with my aunt. I tried to stop him but he was adamant that none of this was her fault and that he was the one who started it and couldn\u2019t let her deal with this on her own. He also said he\u2019s been in love with her since he was a kid. Before he left, he told me that he isn\u2019t angry with me and apologized for being upset before. I told my mom he left and she had no reaction.", "so my wife (26f) and her friends decided to do a 4 day Vegas holiday, she saved up heaps of money to blow on the poker machines and picked out some super sexy outfits. \n\nI'm 27m\n\n3 days into the trip her and her friends decided to drive drunk and they managed to get themselves into an accident, all 4 of them where extremely over the limit and it looks like my wife's friend might be getting jail time.

It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\nedit- never mind, I showed my husband this thread to get him to change his mind and he started laughing because apparently he was joking. I'd be annoyed, but I'm too relieved that he's just obnoxious and not a complete moron.", "Throwaway because I'm sure some people will find this controversial and I don't want it tied to my main.\n\nWhen my wife and I got married we agreed that we would have 2 kids unless both were girls, then we'd have a 3rd to try for a boy. I'm a guy's guy and I grew up with only brothers so I feel strongly that I want a son to bond with. That's not to say that I don't love my daughter equally. I just want to raise someone to follow in my footsteps with sports and girls and stuff. After some convincing, my wife agreed to this but said that if the 3rd kid was a girl, we'd stop trying. Anyway, we ended up having one boy (8 years old) and one girl (5 years old). This background is important because you need to know that having a 3rd kid was something that was on the table.\n\nLast month, our son told us that he likes boys. This is totally fine, I'm not a homophobe, but I'm starting to feel like I want to have a 3rd kid so we can try to have a straight boy. I love my son more than anything and I wouldn't love a straight kid more than him, but at the end of the day I wanted to be able to bond with one of my kids over traditional masculine stuff, which includes women. \n\nMy wife doesn't think that this is a good reason to have a 3rd kid. She said that she would be open to having a 3rd kid but that she finds my reasoning disgusting and she doesn't think she can go through with it knowing the reason for me wanting one. I don't think she understands how special it is for a father to have a son who can follow in his footsteps. Am I the asshole or is she overreacting?", "So last year my brother moved in with me and my roommate. When he moved in his girlfriend started spending a lot of time at our place. This isn't a problem as my roommates girl friend comes over too. Here's the thing though. My brothers gf pretty much eats all our food. No matter who's it it she will eat it. Me and roommate have told her multiple times to stop eating the food we buy and only eat the food brother buys but she ignores us and eats our food anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have confronted her and my brother multiple times and told them she needs to stop but she just says \"tee hee, sorry but it's so good\" and he refuses to say anything about it. We both have tried to talk him into going to her house insted of bringing her over but he doesn't want too. It's gotten to the point where both of us are considering getting a second fridge to put a lock on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, we're both sick of it. Brothers gf is a heavy girl and weight is a very touchy issue with her. Well, recently both of us have taken to calling her miss piggy when she eats our food. If we ever see her eating our food or after she has we confront her and call her it. She hates it and has freaks out each time she hears us refer to her as it. Honestly though, she still eats our food and so we kept doing it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, today when I got home from work his gf was there eating leftovers I had cooked last night. I told her \"Wow, I love to come home to see miss piggy eating my leftovers that I was looking forward too.\" before I started oinking at her. She broke down crying and ran out.  She's been calling my brother furiously since and is refusing to come here anymore because i'm an \"asshole\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm i? Like, we asked her so much to stop and she didn't that i honestly just lost it. We all buy our own food and we have a rule never to touch each others stuff. She knows this and she still did it so I think she deserved it.", "AITA for refusing to eat with my friend because he\u2019s vegan? \n\nLet me explain.\n\nI met my friend Alex in my second year of university when we were both cast in a play together. We hit it off with similar interests and decided to live together last year. \n\nA bit of background: Alex is a vegan - and I mean that as literally as I can. He is a philosophy student and LOVES debating. I think he also has a bit of a superiority complex. Alex talks constantly about the immorality of eating meat. He brings it up daily. He has posters of animated cows looking sadly at steaks hung in his bedroom. He has said, and I am directly quoting, that \u201cEating meat is the same thing as defending slavery because you don\u2019t think the lives of black people have meaning.\u201d He has said \u201cEating meat is the equivalent of joining and supporting ISIS.\u201d \n\nHe is not joking. \n\nHe calls anyone who eats meat \u201ccarnist pigs\u201d. He says this to their face while they eat. He believes it is his life\u2019s mission to educate people out of eating meat and awaken them to veganism. If we are in line together in a restaurant and someone else is ordering, he\u2019ll judge and mock them (out loud) for ordering anything meat or dairy related. He\u2019ll constantly say \u201cHey, check this out!\u201d and show you whatever vegan food he is eating, going into detail about the ingredients and where they come from. By constantly, I mean nearly every time he eats a meal, he does this. He\u2019ll come into your room to show you his plate. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t disagree with him morally. We\u2019ve had dozens of debates on the subject philosophically and I concede on many of his points. There\u2019s no doubt that eating meat is a morally fraut issue. Where I take issue is that he deliberately tries to make people feel guilty for their dietary choices. I have started eating out, or at other people\u2019s houses. I\u2019ve been packing my lunches in secret because I just don\u2019t want to deal with him. \n\nIf anyone tells Alex to piss off, he responds with \u201cCool, have fun murdering!\u201d or \u201cEnjoy your death sandwich!\u201d \n\nSo flash forward to today. We\u2019re in line at a burrito restaurant. I\u2019m ordering my usual thing, and he makes a comment about how I could fill my tortilla with veggies rather than support systemic murder. Similar to the crap he always says. \n\nI look him dead in the eye and tell him, \u201cMan, if you don\u2019t stop doing this shit when we eat, I\u2019m not going to eat with you anymore. The way you behave is inappropriate and hostile and frankly, I\u2019m not interested in being friends with someone who makes it their mission to humiliate people like this.\u201d \n\nHe laughed and told me to chill. I said I was dead serious. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. Not sure the best thing to do here since our lease doesn\u2019t expire until May. I\u2019d love to be able to eat a pepperoni pizza in my home without being called a terrorist.\n\nSo, AITA? How should I go about navigating this? \n\nEdit #1: Obligatory wow, this blew up comment! Thank you for chiming in. For those of you saying this is pretty one-aided - like, yeah. I was mainly seeking advice on how to handle it going forward, and writing it down helps you clarify how crazy shit is when it happens. And I got a lot of helpful tips so thanks! \n\nFor those asking why we are friends: he can be a great guy. We get along and agree on about 95% of other subjects. We have a history together now. I was used to him making jabs, but didn\u2019t know he was this insufferable until we lived together. \n\nFor those saying this is fake - man, I wish. I constantly tell him not to behave like a meme of himself. So I get why it might read that way, but he\u2019s legit.", " I DID NOT BRING THIS UP but when \u201cwhat makes someone good in bed\u201d came up in conversation, my boyfriend asked me point-blank if I think he\u2019s good in bed, and I said no. He\u2019s angry because it\u2019s not his fault I don\u2019t get off, which is true. I can\u2019t get off just from PIV sex, and he doesn\u2019t like the things that do get me off (oral, kissing, foreplay). \n\nI\u2019ve told him twice now, politely, that I\u2019m unsatisfied and I\u2019d like him to do x, y, and z to fix that (initiate, show some passion/lust, occasionally offer to do the things that might help me get off, like play with me with a toy). He agrees he knows how to please me, he just doesn\u2019t make the effort because he doesn\u2019t get anything out of it. So I said \u201cwell yeah that\u2019s literally the definition of \u2018bad in bed\u2019\u201d. He got angry and said it\u2019s my job to \u201cmake\u201d him do those things. I said \u201cwell I can\u2019t enjoy it if I have to force you, that\u2019s not sexy at all\u201d and he got huffy and left. \n\nObviously I\u2019m very grateful that he\u2019s wants to sleep with me at all (I dated my last boyfriend for five years and he really only wanted it once every month or two), but I don\u2019t think that that alone makes someone \u201cgood in bed\u201d. I put a ton of effort into my appearance/fitness, I show initiative and enjoyment in our sex life, I compliment him and make him feel sexy\u2026he does none of those things. Otherwise our relationship is good though, so of course I\u2019d never tank it over this. Was I supposed to just lie to my boyfriend? Am I the asshole here?", "This is something I did not put much thought into but since my Ex expressed her outrage, perhaps the internet can judge this. \n\n\nWithout too much context, my Ex left me and our daughter Jo(not real name) many years ago and I have been raising her all by myself these years. She is 27 now, still living with me and works in a cafe nearby. \n\n\nJo, while having the intelligence of a normal person(aced in Chemistry back in school), has the emotional maturity of a child. It does not take much for her to get upset or become happy, she loves praises and hugs, dislike strangers but warms up to them easily. She gets awkward talking to adults and loves playing with children, but would also pick fights and throw tantrums despite being 3 times their age. I can give more examples but I hope you get the idea. \n\n\nMe and Jo split the house chores and takes turns to cook for each other. We would also do \"Goodbye hug\" and \"Goodnight kiss\" on the cheek every day when we leave for work or go to sleep, separate rooms, to be clear. I would praise Jo if she has done her part of the chores properly as she likes praises, and also buy her snacks from time to time. \n\n\nI have not find another partner after my Ex because Jo would certainly be upset, and I have gotten used to staying this way. Jo has been single too(as far as I know) and has shown no intention of moving out, which I am fine with it. There has only ever been 2 of us in the house after Ex moved. \n\n\nMy Ex, whose private life is not mine to share, paid us a visit some time ago, a long time in many years for an update on Jo. She was absolutely disgusted of our lifestyle. She said we were living like a couple which is not supposed to be, we are father and daughter for christ sake! She demanded that we seek therapy and have Jo moved out so that she can be independent and have her own life. Jo in turn, screamed at her birth mother and kicked her out of the house.  \n\n\nI have nothing on my conscience as we never ever did anything questionable or vile. Therapy? We are both happy adults enjoying our lives. Have Jo move out? If she wants I won't stop her, but if she's happy here then she can stay as long as she likes. \n\n\nI do think I am not the AH who \"ruined\" my daughter's life with this \"unhealthy relationship\", but I shall leave you to judge. AITA?\n\n\nInfo: It is not medically proven but I believe Jo is not in the spectrum or has disabilities as many of you think. She is smart and functional and capable of living by herself(proven when I went business trips and left her home alone when she was in her teens, the house was kept clean and tidy), but she is also lazy and enjoys being spoilt. She has 2 close friends her own age, also single, and would hang out with them sometimes. I also believe that therapy is only required if it cause problems, and if she is happy with her life, even if it is a little out of the norm, I don't think we need any therapy.", "My wife and I have two kids, Kristopher (9) and Sadie (12). For Kris' birthday last Friday, my wife and I decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.\n\nMy wife and I decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because I've heard they have better temperaments. Other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the Humane Society and when I got there, I immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb Pit mix with beautiful green eyes. When I saw her name was Sadie like our daughter, I thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. My wife thought the coincidence was funny when I told her, too, which is important.\n\nSo I arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last Friday after a birthday dinner for Kris. I pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) Sadie. BOTH kids were thrilled but Kris was the happiest I'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until I told them her name. My daughter Sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and IMMEDIATELY insisted that Kris change Sadie's name. She kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so I told her we'd talk about it later.\n\nWell, this week has been hellish. Kris is insistent we keep Sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. He says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and I think he has a point. I also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. My daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. My wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees Sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. I put my foot down because this is Kris' birthday present and his choice.\n\nAITA for not wanting to change the dog's name?", "About 5-6 months ago, I (18f) started having problems with my ears turning red and getting a lil warm. I scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist bc initially I thought it was allergies. Turns out it had to do with the cartilage in my ears rather than the skin. I was referred to a rheumatologist, for whom I had to go make another appointment for, but I couldn\u2019t get in to see her for 3 weeks.\n\nWhile I waited, my ears got worse. To the point where I can no longer leave my room anymore. I have to sit in my room all day, in the dark, in front of a fan, with ice packs strapped to my head because it\u2019s that bad. The burning is excruciating and constant. I can numb it with ice packs, but only until they melt.\n\nALSO during this time, my sister (23f) began to experience lots of issues with cramps and pain in her abdomen. It turns out she has an ovarian cyst which is causing her pain whenever she has her period. I by no means discount that fact that she is in a lot of pain. She is very very vocal about how much it hurts. Here\u2019s where I\u2019m frustrated, however.\n\nOnce I finally get to the rheumatologist, she basically sits down and tells me that I have relapsing polychondritis. Which is a rare genetic autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the cartilage in the body. Since it\u2019s so rare, they don\u2019t know what triggers it, and treatment is mostly trial and error. They worry about long term because cartilage is everywhere in your body, including the heart and windpipe. If my body started to attack either of those, it could spell disaster. Basically, it could flare up in the wrong place at the wrong time and I could die at a young age because of it. The possibility of a flare up in my heart is a major concern, and I just learned all of this on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile my sister is having issues with her cyst again, and is wailing and crying. For sure she is hurting, but also I just learned that I could die at any point. My parents have elected to skirt around that fact, and haven\u2019t offered me a bit of comfort about it, instead focusing on my sister. I am forced (through pure necessity) to sit alone in my room all day long, every day, and have been for the last few weeks. I am extremely lonely. My parents make minimal effort to check on me. At most it\u2019s a brief four sentence conversation and then they go right back upstairs to take care of my sister. Nobody comes to talk to me, nobody comes to see me, nobody sits with me.\n\nTonight I made it it upstairs to get some food, and I saw my mom in my sister\u2019s room, lying on the bed with her, rubbing her back and comforting her. And seeing how much my mom was caring for my sister while also forgetting me made me feel jealous. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that my sister is in a lot of pain. I\u2019m just jealous that I\u2019ve been forgotten about while I\u2019ve learned that I could die young & that I have an autoimmune disorder that I\u2019ll carry with me for the rest of my life. AITA for feeling jealous?", "Little bit of backstory: I really enjoy Pok\u00e9mon and play competitively in tournaments and open a shit ton of packs. Doing this means I have a very large collection of valuable cards. I still love at my parents house (I\u2019m 18), and I keep them all on a shelf in my room. My nephew is 8, almost 9 and he and my niece is living with us because my sister abandoned them for some druggie on the streets. \n\nAnyway, a few days ago I got home from work and was wanting to edit one of the decks I had built for the tournament later in the day. I go to pick up a few deck boxes and a binder and found that one of my binders, and 3 of 9 deck boxes were missing. I immediately freak out because I have them all very organized and well-kept. My nephew has **a lot** of behavioral issues and gets in a lot of trouble both at home and school. He also isn\u2019t ever really disciplined because it would make the situation worse(you\u2019d understand if you met him and my family). So I go into his room to look for them. Lo and behold, there they are, scattered all over the floor, most of them taken out of sleeves, some bent, some of them was thrown in his backpack\u2014oh and my binder was completely empty. At this point I was *beyond* furious and all I could mutter was \u201c Oh my God\u201d over and over. \n\nAfter I pick everything up that I could find, I go upstairs and casually bring him back down to his room and then start screaming at him, and demanding him to find the rest of them. He kept saying he didn\u2019t do it and he didn\u2019t steal them, that they were in his room when he woke up and he thought they were his (keep in mind he lies about *everything*). So I get even madder if that\u2019s possible and I smack the shit out of his leg. Then he starts screaming bloody murder and my nstep dad comes down and demands to know what\u2019s going on. I couldn\u2019t even get a word out before the child went up to him and said I was trying to kill him. My nstep dad coddles him and then gets in my face and threatens to beat me to death if I ever lay another finger on him. \n\nAfter they question him for about an hour, he finally admits that he took them to school and was trading and giving them away with his classmates. His punishment: a stern warning and no tv for the night (which he screamed and cried over). He also said he hates me and wished I would just move out and die. My parents then berated me for a while and essentially told me that I\u2019m a child abuser and if I did that again they would have to call the police and have me charged with assault (mostly my nstep dad saying this, my mom understood what I did and didn\u2019t make it a big deal). All in all I recovered most of the cards losing about 20 out of 250, but with all of the damage that was done to some of the cards I probably lost about $180 of cards. \n\nSo am I the asshole in this situation? Was I overreacting by disciplining him because my parents don\u2019t? I get that it\u2019s not my place to do that, but I completely think that it was deserved and I honestly feel that I should\u2019ve smacked him again. He goes back to school today and I have already contacted his teacher and explained the situation; thankfully, she\u2019s going to confiscate every Pok\u00e9mon card she finds and let me come in after hours to find which ones are mine. Sorry for the lengthy post but I needed to vent my frustrations. AITA? \n\nTLDR: nephew went in my room and stole approximately 250 valuable cards while I was working; I get home and find out and I smack the shit out of him. Then I\u2019m threatened to be killed/ be turned into the police for assault the next time I put my hands on him. \n\nEdit: holy shit my inbox \nand to clear up a few things:\n\nnStepdad means narcissistic stepdad which is a term from /r/raisedbynarcissists \n\nI made this post looking for objective opinions, I personally think he deserved it but what I did was wrong and therefore I\u2019m an asshole. \n\nWe made it to front page :O now everyone will know I\u2019m an asshole D: \n\nEdit 2: I had the intention of replying to most of the comments but that\u2019s no longer reasonable.

The initial chemo put it into remission, but its now come back and its not stopping. \n\nI have been on my second run of chemo for two years, and there has been little to no improvement. Just delaying the inevitable. Most people with leukemia die after 5 years. Mine is even worse.\n\nI feel sick everyday. I used to lift regularly and now all my muscles are basically gone with excess grandma skin on my arms and legs.\n\nI lost so much hair at the top of my head i just started shaving it off.\n\nI cant have sex with my wife anymore, when i try i cant maintain erections. I have pissed myself multiple times over the years in my sleep. I cant eat steaks anymore because of my stomach.\n\nI cant play with my daughters and everytime i go to one of their soccer matches i get weird looks and take all the attention off of them.\n\nI just dont have any fight left anymore. I repeat to myself everyday, \"its over, and thats ok\".\n\nThe truth is i haven't accomplished much in my life. I wanted to be a writer when i was younger but i ended up as an office manager at a car dealership. I always said i would do it later but then the years sort of piled on. I had one life and i wasted it, but so do most people i guess.\n\nI am proud of my wife and daughters. They make me very happy. They haven't accepted that its over yet but i have. My wife means well but she wants me to stay in treatment long enough to put it back into remission again. I dont see it. I just think we need to come to terms with this.\n\nI do not just want to lay in bed all day. I want to travel for these years i have left. See the country. Maybe go to italy or japan or the uk. I want to experience this planet in ways i never thought about before.\n\nI told my wife this and she says im being selfish and im giving up. I dont see it that way, i feel more alive now than ive felt in a long time. I feel like i have no fear of trying scary things or writing a book or travelling to a jungle.\n\nIve spent so many years wasted. She says she wont stick by me if i do this. AITA?", "This happened a little over a week ago and I still feel bad about it. So, my boyfriend has a bit of a hobby collecting knives. Switchblades, butterfly knives, he's pretty proud of all of them. Now, I have a small phobia of my own. My father was very abusive, and of the few memories I have of him, he was often threatening an infant me with a switchblade. As such, I'm very uncomfortable around them. My boyfriend will often point his in my direction, and when I get upset and tell him to stop he says I need to get over it. That I might need to use one some day. That I should know he'd never hurt me. I guess he feels like if he exposes me to it enough, I'll learn to trust that he won't stab me with it? But it's not like I think that to begin with, I'm just uncomfortable around them.\n\nWell, he has a very intense phobia of a specific monster. I don't question it. For some reason, it's much more intense than my mild annoyance/breath stopping moment at the blades. He completely freaks out at even just a picture, shuts down, has nightmares for nights. If there's a chance of one showing up in a video he will whimper and whine and either stop it all together or close his eyes and ask me to tell him when it is over. I promised him early on that I didn't find it funny like some of his friends do and wouldn't use it to prank him.\n\nWell, the other night after cutting some cheese with his stupid knife, he tried waving it at me, knowing how uncomfortable it makes me. So I pulled up a particularly horrifying image of his phobia on my phone and shoved it in his face. \"How does it feel? You know what a phobia is like, right? Just get over it!\" I tried to paraphrase him, and he got really upset. I feel like I may have gone overboard and honestly feel guilty, but he hasn't messed with me since.", "Obvious throwaway because I have friends who know my personal account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I've known my wife for 9 years, we dated for 5, and we've been married for just under 6 months.  She comes from an insanely toxic family, she was emancipated at 16 and to this day refuses to speak to any of her family. They are all addicted to meth and her sister to meth + anything she can get her hands on. Her sister has 3 kids, ages 9 months (F), 6 years (M), and 13 years (F). My wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would. For whatever reason CPS never took the kids away despite near constant monitoring and the last my wife knew of these kids was 3 years ago when she permanently cut her family off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer parents always assumed she would adopt any children her sister produced (this actually was the beginning of the rift that led to her cutting her parents off) and were never shy about it. When we started dating (She was 15, I was 17) I told her that if she adopted those kids then the relationship wouldn't work out because if I am having kids they are going to need to be my own **(EDIT: My mind was going at a million miles per hour when I typed this. This is not an all-encompassing statement. When I typed it I was focused on my current situation. I would not be opposed to marrying someone with kids already, I just expected to never raise these children and I do not want to.)** . She agreed and said she had no desire to ever adopt those kids. \n\n  \nI just deleted like 5 paragraphs worth of useless details because I'm just ranting. I will just get to the point, so out of the blue last week she tells me that she feels guilty about leaving the children behind and she is planning on reaching out to her sister to formally adopt them.  I told her hell no, I made it clear very early on that I do not want to raise those kids. She told me that she assumed I would \"grow out of it\" and accept them. We argued and have been arguing over and over for days now about her decision. She has since reached out to her sister and has started the process of adopting the children. The oldest girl is pregnant, the middle child is a decent kid, and the youngest one only got out of prenatal ICU 5 months ago due to the mother's incessant abuse of drugs during pregnancy.   I am 22, she is 20. I think even if I wanted to adopt these kids I would still want to say no due to our age and financial situation (She works at a make up store, I work at a grocery store for fucks sake)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't straight up told her that I am planning on leaving yet but I've already told my parents that if she doesn't stop then that is my plan.  Am I the asshole here?\n\nLater on edit: Wow, I cannot believe how much vision this got. I'm reading every comment. I really appreciate everyone's insight and perspective (even the incel guy)", "I live close to an elementary school. Every day a small parade of children walk in front of my house on their way to and from school. My girlfriend and I just finished building a small retaining wall of brick along the sidewalk and have noticed it regularly being walked/climbed on. The wall is about three feet tall.\n\nOriginally we were going to plant a lot of flowering bushes along the top of it but we're pretty sure they will be destroyed slowly by the daily coming and going of the kids. We also don't want to be liable for anyone falling and getting hurt. We were at Home Depot to buy flowers the other day when we saw some neat looking bushes that are also a bit pokey. That's when I got the idea to use them as a deterrent. So, will I be the asshole if I plant them along the top of the wall?\n\n**Thank you for the different plant suggestions! Keep em comin! I live in a zone 7 climate.\n\n** There seems to be a minority rising that think I'm out to fuck these kids over and that is very much not the case. I just don't want them climbing all over the wall, which is already happening. I used the term \"pokey bushes\" intentionally as I just want a *deterrent*. Something that is more scary than damaging but will be effective if they actually try anyway. (lol, the people suggesting cholla catus!)\n\n**Due to demand, I'll try to post pictures when it's done. Weather permitting and plant availability it should hopefully be done by Wednesday.\n\n\\*\\*[Here are the pictures of before and after.](https://imgur.com/a/Llp70U9) Sorry they're a little late; it was just my GF and I working on it. The pictures aren't super great and unfortunately, the plants are still quite small as they have just been planted. We're also not done landscaping this portion. Need more fabric to stop weeds and we are going to put something over it(mulch or my GF wants some small black rocks). As for the pokey plants, the plant nearest to the camera is *wild rose* and following the wall we planted a few *lantana*. Both of which should grow out over the wall in the next two years or so. Behind those we have some random white flowers, some salvia and lavender. We then planted a little fig tree and two lilacs on either side of the front door. In the background to the right we planted a jasmine to grow alone the fence. If someone wants to remind me, I can take pictures again next year for some plant growth progress.", "Hello! I posted here before about this girl before because she used to constantly have the heat on in summer. We got that worked out but now everything else is a problem.\n\nI just started college as a freshman at an art school and they gave us the option to join dorms that had our interests and find people to live with who are like us. Our dorm is like an apartment, with two rooms that two people share. The rooms are a bit small but the living room is a big empty space with a couch and a sad little table. \n\nMe and 2 other girls got put into this dorm for gamers and then we had a guy as our 4th so they had to switch us for this last girl very quickly. She's nothing like us, which wouldn't be an issue if she wasn't how she is. \n\nThe first issue that I had with her was the fact that she had the heat on in the dorm, but she got a heater for herself and that got worked out. \nThe school has a wall in each dorm that they specifically let us draw on, it's strange but I like it. The 3 of us are illustration majors while this girl is a photography major. We started drawing on our wall and this girl made a fit about it, saying how we didn't ask if she'd be okay with it. \n\nShe had a 'meeting' with us where she complained that we made the living room a 'gaming room' because my roommate brought her monitor out and plugged in my switch and we played super smash bros one night. It was super fun to me\n\nThis girl has had friends over but complains when I have mine over, and I heard her talking to her friends about us. I have a class with one of her friends and he just kinda gives me weird looks the whole time. When me and my roommate were walking, her friends were sitting on a bench talking and when we walked by they all stoped talking and gave us weird looks again. \n\nShe's vegan, and yesterday sent a long message about how when we make meat we need to clean extremely well for her in the kitchen and stuff, which I understand but it was just so annoying how she she wrote it. \n\nWell, last night I bought a fluffy black rug for the living room in our dorm. I thought it would look nice because of the big empty space. This girl went OFF. she said black is ugly and hides dirt, and I should have consulted everyone when getting a rug. I got this rug because me and the two other roommates went to Target and she didn't wanna come with, and when we saw rugs we thought it would be cool to get one for the living room. When I was out, I picked one up with everyone's happiness in mind. I told her \"nobody consulted me over the dish soap\" and left. That was probably a bad thing to say but I was mad and sad.\n\nShe sent me a long text this morning about how I'm nasty for the soap and the black rug and immature and all these things. I'm just hurt honestly, but maybe I'm the asshole and she's reasonable.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nUpdate: I walked into the living room yesterday to the rug rolled up in a ball, so I just decided to put it in a corner as I didn't want to cause more drama. I sent her a message apologising and asking if we could talk like adults and she's been blatantly ignoring me and being very friendly in our roommate group chat as well as to the others in general. It's hard to just let this go as it makes me feel like trash. I genuinely miss living alone.\n\nEdit: I emailed the RA for my floor and he and i talked about the issues I was having, hopefully we'll have a dorm meeting with an RA to help and if she wants there's an option for her to move to a different dorm\n\nEdit 2: telling me to drop out of art school is not helpful in any way and your opinion is not wanted.

The details of \u201cwhy\u201d are not important but I\u2019m angry, embarrassed, lost and sad any given moment of the day. A lot of this has to do with feeling like I\u2019ve been \u201creplaced\u201d by a 23 year old surfing instructor who is everything I\u2019m\nnot. My husband and kids claims that she is just his friend and helping him learn his life long desire to surf but Jesus Christ...give me a break. \n \n\nMy husband has primary custody because he had better lawyers who were able to manipulate some minor missteps on my part into the court seeing them as a huge deal. So this past weekend I picked up the kids and said we were going to visit my parents. They said they would rather use thier season passes to sea world since they spent all weekend with my parents and Aunt Stacey and Uncle Brian (my brother and sister who I didn\u2019t even know were in town). I was like your dad took you? They said yes that my parents had invited him over to see everyone. I was devastated because while I don\u2019t get along with my brother and sister (and my mom) they let my ex-husband know they were coming and not me. I can\u2019t even let that sink in without tears forming. I sort of jested that \u201coh and let me guess Ms Surf Instructor was there too?\u201d My daughter said \u201cwell actually we all went to her house in ocean beach because she gave Stacey and Brian lessons after ours.\u201d That included my mom and dad. I was so devastated I took the kids back home and just went home and cried for an hour. \n\nWhen I was done I sent a furious email to my entire family how inappropriate they all had been and then not only hanging out with my ex for an entire weekend, but his little chippy as well is a massive slap in the face and the fact they didn\u2019t even tell they were in town let alone invite me makes me feel so alone. \n\nMy mom was the only one to respond and she basically said \u201cyes it was rude we didn\u2019t tell you Stacey and Brian were  here and we shouldn\u2019t have done that.

I thought that this was a bold claim and decided to put it to the test. After the waitress took our order, I put a timer on my phone and put it in front of me on the table. It felt weird to do it, but I wanted to have some sort of proof so that they didn\u2019t think I was trying to scam them. Sure enough, 18 minutes passed before we got our food. I showed the waitress my timer and she apologized and said that she\u2019d waive the bill. After we finished, I made sure to tip double of what it would\u2019ve been without the promotion. AITA?

My parents migrated overseas to where we live now with my sister and had me, completely born in an English speaking environment. I can speak Mandarin, but usually only at home, and I study in a school with English as first language. \n\n\nWe went to my father's hometown in Szechuan Chengdu last month, and welcomed by our grandparents who threw a big reunion party with my uncles aunts and cousins, about 20+ people. They speak in Szechuan dialect as their mother tongue, but are able to understand and speak Mandarin too. While my parents(obviously) and sister(able to understand but can only speak Mandarin) are comfortable with it, I have trouble understanding the dialect.\n\n\nI tried to ask an uncle speaking to me to speak Mandarin, but was responded with laughter, the other relatives also seemed to enjoy my confusion. That uncle, using Mandarin, told me that I am a banana who has forgotten her roots before turning back to dialect. My parents told me not to act selfishly and expect everyone to change for me. It was awkward and frustrating to be the only one in a house of strangers(yups, relatives but strangers) who had no idea what others were saying. \n\n\nSince they were comfortable, I figured I might as well as make myself comfortable too. When an aunt came to speak to me again, I responded in English, this time enjoying her confused face. Even though I had no idea what they were talking about, I spoke English throughout the rest of the party.\n\n\nI had an earful from my parents after that, they said that I was disrespectful and a walking form of embarassment and because of me they got scolded from my grandparents for teaching me to behave this way. My sister(secretly) supported me though, saying they had what was coming for teasing me like that. AITA?", "Hello r/aita. Throwaway for what I hope are obvious reasons. \n\nThis post is the product of years of family drama that basically all center around my brother. He was raised as the true \"golden child\" of the family, much to the detriment of my and my sister. We were a very upper middle class family and my brother was the center of the \"wrong crowd\" and his life is in absolute shambles. He is 24 now and if I had to guess, my parents have spent $500,000 on various colleges, rehab programs and facilities, actor's workshops, investment schemes and on and on. It could be a little less, it could be a lot more. The heartbreak of seeing my brother fail time after time had to be a major factor in my dad having a heart attack and dying at 63 four years ago.\n\nMy brother showed back up in Chicago area last summer with a sob story about why he failed out of the last rehab my mom had paid for but this time he claimed he was \"voluntary\" homeless. My mom couldn't handle this so without checking with my or my sister, mom concocted this plan that the three of our households would \"take turns\" hosting my brother so he wouldn't have to be on the streets (my mom's new boyfriend, who is a decent guy, can't stand my brother and probably put his foot down to taking brother on full time). So when I was told about this and when my \"turn\" first came around I told my brother that in no uncertain terms that he could stay, but he had to come to work at my company, I had to be with him at all times and he had to pay his room and board through helping me with fix up our house.  He wanted no part of that and has chosen to be homeless during every two week period that he was supposed to come stay with me. I have not seen him since and since I know my mom and sister have not put a hard line on him, I know he is still using. \n\nWell as the national news will tell you, we are in a massive deep freeze and of course this coincides with my two weeks to keep him. He showed up at my house on Friday night when we started hearing just how cold it was supposed to get. I told him that he had four choices, he could avail himself of the services that the city was putting together and remain homeless, he could go back with my mom or sister, he could take me up on my offer to work and help around the house OR I would buy him a bus ticket to Florida to get out of the cold. \n\nWell I don't think he caught the meaning of a one way bus ticket. What I know he thought was happening is that I was giving him a ticket to go party on the beach until the cold passed and then I would provide for him to come home. When I dropped him off at the bus station earlier in the week he point blank asked me \"when and how will you send the return ticket?\"  I told him there was no return ticket, take what I was giving him or stay in the cold.  He proceeded then to unleash an angry cursed filled rant accusing me of every family sin under the sun until I kicked him out of my car. I know he got on the bus, beyond that I have no idea what happened to him and I care even less. \n\nedit: he absolutely knew I was giving him a one way ticket. Sorry for the confusion. He just thought this was an open ended party in Florida and I would be sending him a return ticket when he was ready to come home. There was no illusion or subterfuge on my part about the ticket. \n\n\nMy mom is outraged at me, to the point where she is talking about suing me for \"great bodily harm\" (whatever that is supposed to mean), cutting me out of her will and estate and even telling my wife she'll introduce her to divorce attorneys. My sister has quietly thanked me because she wasn't sure how she was going to break it to my mom that she wasn't taking my brother in anymore because her fianc\u00e9 was sick of him. \n\n\nSo from the view of my mom, I am not only an asshole, I have apparently put my brother's life in danger. \n\n\nFrom me and my sister's view I have washed our hand's of a long standing problem, at least for a little while. \n\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\n\nedit2: wow this is easily my biggest post ever, by a large margin. I have about 410 unread posts as of this morning. I very much will try to read all of them. \n\nThere's one thing I just want to address really quickly. People are saying \"YTA\" because I blame my dad's heart attack on my brother. Surely you can say that my dad may have had a heart attack sooner or later but he died at 63 years old. Other men on his side of the family have lived well into their 80s and 90s (my Dad's dad is still alive as an example, my two greatgrandfathers lived to 98 and 102 as another example). There is no doubt in my mind that stress of having to deal with my brother absolutely contributed to his poor health. I am no doctor but the links between stress and heart trouble are pretty well established and it got so bad at the end that my dad's own cardiologist  was advising him that he had to let my brother go or it would kill him. My dad died after a series of small heart attacks and \"big one\" that started occurring after he went to somewhere in New Mexico and rescued my brother who was prostituting himself for meth and heroin, all while my parents were sending him something like $3500 a month for living expenses to get himself \"back on track.\" To me the link is so absolute that I feel 100% justified in blaming my brother for my dad's death. You can judge me all you like but the pictures of how my dad changed from a robust man in his late 30s when my brother was born to a broken shell by the time he died would maybe change your judgement. ", "Using a throwaway. \n\nSo, there's a FtM trans guy at my school, let's call him Don (since I'm watching mad men, lol) who recently came out as trans. He says he isn't transitioning using harmone therapy or anything of the sort to transition. As a girl, he was a pretty good swimmer on the team who did the 100M. He switched over to the male team. The coach casually told him the competition might be a little stiff (not in a harsh or transphobic way, more just 'you might want to be aware/prepare yourself' way). Don nodded along and said that's okay.\n\nBut the way he's been acting recently shows he thinks it's anything except fair. Since our swim team is pretty competitive (we're won state just last year), his times for the 100m fell to near the bottom of the pack. And he's been whining about this, calling it unfair and saying he should get a handicap of some sort. \n\nI disagree with this, partially. I do agree that it's unfair that he has to swim with cis guys as a biological female not undergoing transition. But he decided to join the male team, knowing the competition would be stiff. I know it may be have been triggering for him to stay on the girls team, but it's a trade-off: if he wants to be on the male team, he can hardly expect to be given advantages over other guys. \n\nOne time, after practice when Don was complaining, I civilly shared my opinion. He got offended at this.\n\nAm I TA here?", "So I have this friend that I introduced to anime and k-pop a while back. A few months later, he's obsessed with them and I would consider him a full-on koreaboo and weaboo. For example, he says \"ban-kai\" (a power from BLEACH) out of nowhere and I feel a sense of disappointment for what he has become. As well as when we are in uni he starts singing k-pop songs without knowing those actual lyrics. I just want my old friend back, not the one that would say \"nani\" after everything I say. I can't bear to confront him about it since I'm the one that introduced him to it, but the amount of cringing I do a day is detrimental to my well-being.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: thanks for the gold stranger!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 2: I didn't notice this was on the front page.

She was really gorgeous ,confident and free spirited. I loved how silly and bold she was, it was something that made her really unique in my book. \nThis whole thing happened a month ago. I had a really, really big presentation and I got really tensed. I had the opportunity to invite my gf to the function, and so I did, on the condition that she would not embarrass me and not drink, because she had a habit of drinking a lot during such occasions and losing control. \n\nWell, turns out she made fun of me just because she thought it was hilarious. She burped loudly when I was talking to my co workers, and told about how I didn\u2019t even have sex because of the stress. She proceeded to ask my coworkers if they could resist her body. They were obviously uncomfortable too. The presentation ultimately went horribly bad at first because she kept making stupid silly faces backstage, but then I just ignored her for the rest of the night and all went well.\n\nFirst thing I did when we sat in the car was saying I was breaking up with her that night, she told me she was just trying to lighten my mood. I refused to let her touch me then, and dropped her off to her building. She said she wasn\u2019t going to go till we sorted out the issue, I just told her to get out.\n Then I gave her a text message saying I was sorry for being rude to her but we weren\u2019t compatible, and to just move on with her life.\n\nFast forward to today, I bumped into a friend of hers who said that I had been an asshole for her to break up with her for being \u2018silly\u2019 at a gathering, and that no one could believe I turned out to be such a jerk.\n\nNow I am already seeing someone, but this interaction made me question if I had indeed been a jerk. An unbiased opinion would help.\n\nEDIT:I did shout get out at her to make her leave, since she just kept talking and talking.\n\nEdit 2: Each comment honestly helps me a lot , and while I personally cannot thank everyone of know, know that I geniunely mean it.

I will try my best to maybe learn more about it and keep my mouth shut. I do really like this girl, but it was just something I was grossed out by.

However today we wanted to try finishing the job.\nIt wasn\u2019t bad or anything, however afterwards he refused to kiss me. We kind of had a discussion about it.

He is the best bf in the world and I love him very much. Both of us have not had any previous relationships, so we still encounter new things regularly and we are still learning.\n\n\nSecondly, I understand that not everybody likes cum. That\u2019s why I had already flushed my mouth with water before I came back for a kiss. Especially since I know my boyfriend can be quite squeamish sometimes. After this I just felt kind of rejected because the idea of kissing me disgusted him so much.\nI asked him after reading the comments if he felt like I pressured him into something he didn\u2019t want to do and I apologized. Pressuring him was definitely not my intention, I would never want to do that to him. He said he didn\u2019t feel that way and that he was sorry too for making me feel rejected.\n\n\nWhatever your verdict may be, thank you all for your comments!", "Hi. Made a new throwaway account to post this because I am... wildly conflicted right now.\n\n**Backstory:** My sister (4 years younger than me) and her husband have been married \\~2yr, together for 5. BIL and I dated during high school, and it ended under circumstances that were not ideal. BIL and I have not gotten along since he and sister got together. My sister essentially believes I'm jealous of her for marrying my \"one who got away\" (he is not that), so our relationship has ALSO suffered as a result. This whole situation is already fucked up and yes, I'm pretty sure it's putting my therapist's kid through college, but that's not the problem right now.\n\nRecently BIL has begun reaching out to me more frequently. I've been very cautious but after talking it over with people in my own life, chose to be more friendly toward him as part of an attempt at repairing certain aspects of my relationship with the entire family. Last week BIL asked if I would read a book he had written, with the underlying implication that I would help him career-wise with his aspirations as a writer. Out of politeness and curiosity, I said sure, thinking I would perhaps get a good laugh out of it and a story to tell my publishing friends.\n\nThe book... is about us. I don't know how else to put it. It's a \"domestic thriller\" (so think *Gone Girl, You,* etc.) about a man who realizes he has married \"the wrong sister\" and becomes obsessed with his SIL. It's one of the weirdest things I have ever seen. It doesn't exactly read like a manifesto, more like something you'd see on r/menwritingwomen, but aspects of the story were deeply unsettling to me personally (touching on things that happened to me in high school and later), and I don't understand why he would give this to me to read unless he wanted to either creep me out, or - as in the story - he intends to leave my sister and wanted to see if this would... Jesus, it's too weird to say. Open a door with me?\n\nHere's how I'm conflicted. People have always used art as a form of cathartic healing. If a stranger handed me this book, I would just say \"not my taste\" and move on. That said, this is my sister's husband, and I found certain elements so skin-crawlingly uncomfortable that I almost didn't finish it. That ALSO said, this is my sister's husband, and I am afraid, based on the past, that if I tell her about this, she will flip out on me and not him, and/or if she confronts him, he will also just lie about the whole thing? And on the off-chance that it's more than just tasteless catharsis, I don't want my sister to get turned into a skin suit? (There are no skin suits but you get it.) And if it IS just a fictional fantasy thriller, I'll either look like a paranoid asshole or the lawmakers who tried to ban video games after Columbine.\n\n**TLDR: My BIL and I dated in high school and he wrote a really creepy novel about being obsessed with me and I don't know whether to tell my sister for the shitstorm it could cause.**\n\n**EDIT: Whew.

We make it clear that our support group is made strictly for people with body deformities, amputations, severe scarring, disfigurations of some sort... It is not for people who struggle with self esteem and need a boost.\n\nAt our first August meeting, a girl showed up whom we'll call Ashley. There wasn't anything visibly \"wrong\" with Ashley, but we didn't give it much thought since in some cases the scarring or whatever else can be hidden underneath clothes. (In my case, a long sleeved shirt hides nearly all of my upper body burn scarring). However, whenever Ashley spoke, she would never mention what she was struggling with just that she was disgusted with her body. The first two sessions, I thought it was fine, to each their pace and I didn't want to force her to share anything she wasn't comfortable with sharing. Even when we would wrap up the meetings and the members would chat to each other, she didn't reveal what exactly it was that made her seek out our support group.\n\nAt our third meeting, Ashley showed up wearing a crop top and very short shorts, and again there was nothing visibly \"wrong\". She dodged every question I directed towards her asking about why exactly she was here, asking her if she was a veteran, if she had a surgery... She left quickly when we wrapped up and I couldn't speak with her. Other members asked me what the deal with her was since she went on an other tangent about how disgusting her body was when it was her turn to speak without talking about what her physical defect was exactly or how it was impacting her day to day life.\n\nLast saturday's meeting, I approached Ashley before the meeting to voice my concerns alongside those of the rest of the members. Ashley responded saying we weren't very \"nice\", and that whenever she would speak up negatively about her body and such, we would never counter her with a compliment, we would just stay silent or tell her some \"mumbojumbo\" about how it takes time to come to terms with it. I was getting pretty angry, and I directly asked her why is it that she was here, and I told her if she couldn't give me an answer I'm afraid I would have to kick her out. She didn't answer so I asked her to leave. \n\nShe contacted my co-runner (he organizes and plans timings, deals with the community center...) and he seems to think what I did is not justified, and that I shouldn't turn away anyone or kick them out because of the way they grieve or deal with trauma.

About 15 minutes after the guests arrived I see the delivery guy at our front door. I tell my MIL to get up and she asks why. I tell her that the delivery guy is here so she can pay him. She looks at me stunned and asks \"why should I pay him\". So I have to expain that because she ruined the pasta salad she has to pay for the new one. She finally gets up to pay him but it's incredibly awkward and my wife is giving me the death stare. The guests seem kinda awkward too and my MIL didn't talk to me at all for the rest of the party.\n\nAfter the guests were gone my wife flipped her shit at me. She called me an imbecile and an asshole and said that I embarassed myself and damaged the realationship to her mother. It's been three days and she's still angry about this. AITA?\n\nEdit: Ok, I think the judgement has been clear. I will try to fix it, although I'm not sure yet how to.  \n\nI also wanted to say that it wasn't my intention to emberass MIL, I hoped that she would get up so I could explain it to her in private.", "My sister started living with me recently and pays me reduced rent. I was away from home for about a week due to work. I gave her a simple rule of forbidding her bringing anyone over. Not her new boyfriend or her friends. No exceptions to this rule. Well she broke that rule.\n\nDuring my week away. One of her Instagram posts showed her BF wearing one of my jackets on a night out. I called her out on it and she apologised and told me she put everything back. So now I know that he has been in my room and going through my things. \n\nWhat killed me inside was that she also had a party. Lots of drinking involved. Including my vintage whisky. They cost me around \u00a37000 and were near full. So I demanded that they pay me back. \n\nMy sister is begging me that she didn't know and thought her boyfriend bought them. Her boyfriend blocked me and called me crazy. He is now thinking about breaking up with her over this. Everyone I know is calling me an asshole for demanding they cover my loss. Apparently I should forgive a simple mistake. So AITA?", "My gf since June just \u201ccame out\u201d to me as aesexual.   I knew the term and honestly never thought about how their lives are.  I guess I just figured they lived alone.  \n\n\nMy gf however just told me that she was aesexual.  I asked her about our sex and she said she had been faking it.  That she didn\u2019t want to lose me. \n\nI feel so gross.  We have had sex a lot.   If she didn\u2019t enjoy that, it\u2019s just idk wrong.  \n\nShe cried when I said I don\u2019t think I can have a relationship without sex.   Like sobbed.   She said that\u2019s why she never told me. \n\nI asked her how she saw our relationship progressing.  She was really adamant that we could make it work.  That we could even have kids.   But as far as sex I could just get sex toys. \n\nA relationship with her on her terms really just sounds like friends with a kid.   I already have friends.   I don\u2019t want to have a kid with them.   \n\nShe\u2019s super emotional right now, I don\u2019t know how to deal with it honestly.  Her friendship relationship doesn\u2019t work for me.

While I was there I wound up having a drunken one-night stand with an old friend I went to school with.\n\nThe next morning I woke up to her crying, she said she was in a serious relationship and our hookup was a big mistake. I instinctively apologized, but she insisted it was all her fault, and I had no reason to apologize. I gave her my word that I will keep quiet about things, and this would just be our secret.\n\nI've kept my word for years. I never said nothing to anyone, I've actually almost forgot about it myself. \n\nAbout a month ago, I was scrolling through Facebook when I seen something that shook my whole world up. I seen a picture of my daughter sitting on some random guy's lap. After a doubletake and a thorough inspection, I realized this was not my daughter. I realized that it was my old friend's husband and their daughter.\n\nThe resemblance is uncanny those girls are almost twins. The math adds up and, my thoughts have been driving me crazy for a month now. I want to say something, I feel like I need to know the truth. I need to put my mind to rest. I don't want to break a family, but after my mom passed away, I found out that me and my children are at high risk for colon cancer. If she is my child, I feel like this is something she needs to know.\n\nEDIT: If I found out she was mine, I would most definitely want to be a part of her life. What kind of man would I be if I didn't? I agreed to keep her infidelity a secret, I never agreed to let another man raise my child. \n\nI feel guilty, because the two of them look so happy in that picture. I would hate to spoil the relationship between those two. I couldn't imagine if I found out my daughter wasn't mine.  But at the same time I can't imagine missing out on my child's life.", "I don't want a baby. I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\nUPDATE: first of all i'd like to apologise, I mislead you, my SO and I are recently engaged, not yet married. I said, wife, because i realise that a very large section of the people who read this would tell me to leave the relationship because being in the same headspace is essential for marriage. if she leaves me because she wants a family then i understand, but it's not an option I'm considering. \n\nI love her massively, I don't think she is interested in heading back onto the dating scene, and oxygen tanks can put some guys off. I've promised her i will look after her and I'm not going back on that. - im really sorry about that guys, i was trying to narrow down the advice to just yes or no rather than reading through loads of comments telling me to GTFO, but i accidentally made some people question if this was real - and by extension question their faith in humanity.... \n\nSecondly, when my SO and i met shortly before she was diagnosed and told that a baby was off the table, so we headed towards our future assuming that we were on the same page. \n\nthirdly, many people are asking what her illness is, i wasn't going to say because i was worried she would find the post and get upset. but because this thread is becoming so popular i think its a good opportunity to raise awareness about a very rare illness called pulmonary hypertension. you can read about it here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/causes/\n\nfinally I would like to thank all of you. Almost without acception, you have been incredibly kind and supportive. some of you think I should have the baby, some of you think its a terrible idea, but all of you are being honest, supportive and kind.

She\u2019s been vegan about a year, and wasn\u2019t when we met, I have always been an omnivore and never suggested that would change. Now that we found a place, she now says that she doesn\u2019t want to live with me if I don\u2019t agree to go vegan. I responded with [this](https://i.imgur.com/rd4a9Ck.jpg) after my frustration reach epic levels AITA?\n\n**Edit**: our child is being raised vegan against my wishes but in the interest of compromise I leave it alone and made sure our child eats as complete a diet as possible. \n\nCurrently I only eat meat 2-3 days a week at most. I already agreed not to eat meat around here, my meat eating at \u201cour\u201d place would be limited to when she isn\u2019t there. \n\nI forgot to mention I have a child from a previous relationship that will be living with us, and that child is expected to go vegan as well.\n\n**Edit 2**: I agree with anyone that says my response was immature and counterproductive.\n\n**Update 1: we spoke and this summarized what I said:**\n\n\u201cYesterday doesn\u2019t sit well with me, your attitude towards it is controlling, and the fact you\u2019re not willing to even explore compromises is troubling. For instance, the few times I eat or cook meat could be done when you aren\u2019t home, I could get a small bar fridge to store meat, there\u2019s a million solutions that could have been discussed if you really wanted this to work. Your attitude surrounding it is controlling and unreasonable, I am asked to make incredible sacrifices because you\u2019re unable to compromise, or unwilling to. This will become a pattern, because you know I want this more than you, and you won\u2019t have to compromise cause I\u2019ll cave to have our family.\n\nYou have a right to state how you feel, as I do. If you choose to ignore my feelings entirely up to you. But the lack of communication about this isn\u2019t going to change anything. I want you and this family, but I\u2019m not rolling over and changing every time you decide you believe in something else, compromise is a two way street, and if we aren\u2019t going to walk it together as equals, in ideas, feelings, respect, and communication, then we say goodbye now. \u201c\n\n**Addition: I feel like I should add this reply I made to a militant vegan here **\n\n~~https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d2bg73/_/ezuc01f/?context=1~~\n\nI replied to the wrong comment and now I can\u2019t find it.\n\n**Update 2:** All she\u2019s said to me is \u201cI\u2019m dreaming of a future that I won\u2019t have. \u201c not sure what that means but I don\u2019t want to go down any more rabbit holes today. I think I\u2019ll try tomorrow evening to talk to her, I\u2019ll give her time to consider my words abs to collect her thoughts. Right now I want to think about everything that\u2019s been said here, specifically about my younger child being vegan, my family, what\u2019s best for everyone, and most importantly what kind of future do I see with her right now.  I\u2019ve read every comment, and this has turned into a very spirited debate. I believe there\u2019s merit to reducing meat intake for your health and for the environment, but I don\u2019t believe in extreme knee jerk reactions to anything. I have reading to do..\n\n**thoughts:** I am not criticizing vegans, and in the reply (to the wrong comment) that\u2019s causing me to get hate mail, I was referring to a specific subset of vegans, I would have expressed similar sentiments to a religious fanatic that was forcing his or her beliefs to me. \n\nI support her right to live the life she wants, and to eat what she wants. I want the same accommodation. \n\nWas I the asshole here? IMHO Yes in some ways I was. Is she the asshole for the ultimatum? Possibly. What I know for sure is I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever understand how this \u201clifestyle\u201d and diet is a reasonable justification to change the nature of the family at its core. \n\nSome have called me a pushover, that may be true, but I\u2019m trying my best to navigate waters that are unfamiliar to me, and to make the best decisions for me and my family.\n\nI am reading most of your comments, and to those who say I\u2019m being intolerant, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m seeking compromise. To those who say a child should be raised as a vegan, I agree and have from the start, that choice was made unilaterally and the safe guards and information gathering  we agreed to hasn\u2019t happened.", "My husband NEVER charges his phone.

Called the phone, phone is dead.  I figured he was on his computer, so I sent a video message to his computer.  He called me back, and boy was he pissed.  He said he was sick of me spying on him with all of my cameras.  He went on at some length about me spying on him.  I\u2019m not.  I don\u2019t give a shit what he does at home.

A couple minutes or so go by and a lady approaches me and says something to the effect of \"just so you know, you weren't here first. Other people were in there cars before you got here\". I am a little taken aback and say \"no, the line starts when someone starts standing in front of the building\". I was certain I was in the right and that this was just one odd lady and that nearly everyone would agree with me. \n\nBut then we start to notice a pattern.

Paul took us aside early on and told us she suffers from severe anxiety and depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur friend group is very close and hang out a least once a week. Paul brings Ella because she says she cannot be left alone due to her mental health issues. We didn't have any issues with this at first, but after 2+ years we are kind of tired of her for these reasons: If we are doing an activity that day that she doesn't enjoy, she will complain the ENTIRE time. She is picky so she has the final say in all restaurant choices. Despite being around us for 2+ years, if Paul gets up to get a drink or use the bathroom she will follow him. She also rarely speaks to us directly and kind of uses Paul as a sock puppet to tell us things. When she does speak to us directly, it's usually to call us out on something. Some examples include walking past a homeless man and not giving him money, spending too much money on X when you could have given it to charities instead, etc. mostly moral things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have told Paul multiple times that her behavior (mostly the complaining part) is unappreciated. Every time he's tried to talk to her about it, he says it causes her to have a panic attack. We love to hang out with Paul and Paul gets very upset if we choose not to invite him to things because of Ella, but we're kind of tired of only doing things Ella likes and eating at the same 3 restaurants. So last week we told Paul that when invite him to things we are ONLY inviting him. We decided that Ella is invited to big events like Christmas parties and the occasional hangout, but only when we literally invite her. Paul did not take this well.

My wife said that she\u2019d want me to choose the baby if it came to that. I told her there was no fucking way I would do that, we could have another baby but I could never have another her. She got all mad and questioned my commitment to being a father and I said I\u2019m committed to being a father but I\u2019m more committed to being a husband. This argument went on forever.

I don't think they hated each other or anything like that. Honestly, I think the divorce had more to do with it. Because of reasons I won't go into here, his ex-wife basically had sole custody of their son and the two of them never had a chance to fix that relationship. \n\nAnyway, my husband held some animosity about the whole affair because he felt like his son sided against him in the divorce. Right before he passed he made me promise not to give his relatives any of his possessions (he had a bad relationship with his family and he owned some family heirlooms) and I asked him \"what about \\[son's name\\]\" and he paused and he said \"he doesn't get anything either\". Honestly, I was shocked, but I was pretty much grieving at this point so I didn't question it. \n\nWell, about a month ago his son reached out to me over email asking if he could have a couple of his father's items. He said he's been regretting that they never repaired their relationship and that he never got to say a proper goodbye. The items he asked about were small things like a gold lighter he remembers (I still have it) and a blue button up shirt (I don't know which one specifically, but I still have all of his old clothes). I responded and told him that unfortunately it would go against his father's wishes to give him anything and he replied very politely \"I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks for responding.\" and that was it. \n\nAbout a week later his mother sends me an email calling me names and a bitch for not giving her son the things he asked for and that I'm basically preventing him from moving on. I didn't respond and I blocked her email and I haven't heard anything since. \n\nI've been feeling sick ever since this happened. I'm still trying to move on from his passing and I'm not trying to stop him from moving on, I'm just trying to honor my deceased husbands wishes, but I feel like I've done the wrong thing and I don't know how to handle this. \n\nWas she right? Am I in the wrong?", "Sorry if the title is off and for any mistakes here goes,\n\nI visited the shelter because I was feeling low and cats are awesome so I thought I\u2019d volunteer and maybe get some cat therapy.\n\nSo I went down with my BFF and BF and we played with kittens and old cats (PS: favourite gala name was granny and she was so moody, I loved it). I saw my now cat Zuzu, I didn\u2019t go up to her at first because I knew I\u2019d fall in love with her. So my foresight didn\u2019t save me and I learnt she had been abandoned since late Jan 2019. It was then May, so she had been there for +/-5 months. I spoke with the manager and he said he\u2019d phone the owner and see if they\u2019d get back to him and he told me to wait a week. So I did, I confirmed payment on her shots and snips and waited another 3 days for the owner to contact back. They never did. \n\nSo it\u2019s now a about month in an I post a pic of her on social media, the owner is a distant acquaintance, a friend of a friend kind of thing. It\u2019s a small town. She sends me a direct message and claimed ownership. I explained the situation as well as the attempts at contact and she called bullshit. She never addressed the abandonment, and bowed when I firmly stated that the cat was now in my care and I would provide her with a lovely home. She hasn\u2019t responded yet and I did apologize to her in the messages. It\u2019s weird I know where she lives and works, it\u2019s one of the nice bars in town. She\u2019s a sweet person but,\n\nI just feel bad. I understand cat love. I understand bonds, but how can you leave a kitten in a shelter for +/-5 months? How long is that even in cat time? \n\nI\u2019m conflicted but feel like I\u2019m doing the right thing. I thought very long about bringing a cat into my home and even got the support of my housemates and close friends. I gathered supplies and made what I couldn\u2019t afford. I love that fluffy stinkball, but how do I manage this relationship in a small town? Do I ignore it? I just don\u2019t know how not to be the asshole here...\n\nEdit: \nAbandoned as in at a shelter, not on the side of the road. Left there after being put into boarding,\n\nThe local SPCA does have a boarding facility but on weekly fee basis.

He basically said he had a great time talking to me, and was hoping that we could meet up some time to talk again in the future. \n\nThis made me really uncomfortable because I never gave him my phone number. He must have gotten it from my profile with the dealership.

I would have no doubt about it if he had made me uncomfortable during our irl interaction, but we had a pleasant conversation.

She\u2019ll bring up pictures of her female classmates and ask me or my dad or my 24 year old sister how old they look or she\u2019ll compare herself to her sister (my aunt) and get my dad to say that my mom is prettier and skinnier than her sister. When pretty actresses are on tv she\u2019ll make comments to my dad like \u201cHere\u2019s your woman. She\u2019s a redhead. You can go ahead and leave me for her\u201d and such.

If you thought it stopped when we picked my sister up, you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nAfter we got back home, I refused to get out and asked him to take me to my apartment. I was **SO** embarrassed and my boyfriend was visibly uncomfortable. I have since blocked my mom\u2019s phone number and got my sister to bring the spare key I had given my parents so they no longer have access to my apartment. My sister comes here to visit with me because I can\u2019t stand to be around my mother. I have apologized so much to my boyfriend for my family and he told me that he\u2019s sorry, but he isn\u2019t sure if the relationship will go further and needs time to think.\n\nI\u2019m so angry and hurt it\u2019s unreal.", "Before I start I want to mention that I would\u2019ve totally helped out if she asked but she didn\u2019t ask me. And forgive me English is not really my first language.\n\nAnyway my girlfriend was cleaning the house today. She started early in the morning and I wasn\u2019t awake when she started. Today is my day off so I would really like to relax, I slept in today until 11am. I expected to wake up peacefully but not really I heard the vacuum very loudly but I just decided to ignore it. I put some headphones on and that was it. My girlfriend is coming in and out of the room to clean and I notice she is looking annoyed. Well she walks in one last time and is all angy with me, and she starts complaining that she\u2019s busting her has cleaning the whole house and that I don\u2019t have the decency to lift a finger to help her. Well I got really mad at that and I told her this is my day off and I simply want to enjoy it but instead I wake up to the vacuum running and now my girlfriend nagging me. I told her she could\u2019ve ASKED me if she want help but it\u2019s not my response lability. She got even more pissed and then left the house and now my mood is absolutely ruined. I just wanted a nice day off. AITA for not lifting a finger to help her on my day off *even though she didn\u2019t ask me???*", "My brother Howard [32M] and I [24F] are renting a house from our father. Originally it was just me and a cousin, but Howard moved in when she left. Howard and his wife, Janis, have two kids. My niece [5F] and nephew [2M] spend half the week with one parent, and half the week with the other. Howard has them from Friday to Monday morning. \n\nThe current problem\u2014\n\nI have tried to talk to my brother about his expectations of \u201chelp\u201d and that I find them unreasonable. I am not the second parent in the household, I view us living together as roommates, not really a family unit. I am here until I finish school and can move out on my own. \n\nHe wants to go to the gym or go out with friends, but the times he wants to go are during MY only free time. I feel like I shouldn't be asked to give up my free time when babysitters are available for that kind of thing--he is just too cheap to hire one. His argument, that he would do the same for me, is empty. I don't plan to have kids. He has insulted me for not dropping everything to watch his kids, calling me \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cshallow\u201d for not helping him out. \n\nHoward says-- \n\nI have an issue with my sister not helping because we live together and we should, as a family, be willing to help when need be. I feel like she has done very little to help with the kids. \n\nShe makes her own meals, but she doesn\u2019t offer to help make meals for the kids. She is not home much, but when she is, she will order something small to the house and not ask if I want anything [I will give her $$$]. \n\nWhen I ask her to help me get the kids ready for something, she tells me no. We have gotten into arguments because she will see I am trying to get the kids ready and she just leaves, without even asking if I am okay. \n\nI need to get away from the kids sometimes. I have asked her to watch the kids while I get milk from the store. She says she will pick up the milk for me. When I tell her I need a minute alone, she says the offer is \u201cI get the milk or nothing.\u201d \n\nI am drowning in debt, I have a failing marriage, my kids are a lot, and my parents live far away. I just need some help and she has refused to be more than a passing stranger in their lives. I am hurt, overwhelmed, and resentful\u2014which I don\u2019t want to be. But I feel like she could help more, or even a little bit. \n\nOur dad has a pool in the back. She swims laps every morning. It was 90* here the other day and the kids wanted to swim. I had to take calls and asked if she would watch them for 20 minutes. She said, no she was finishing laps, making breakfast, and going out with friends. So she didn\u2019t have time. I would desperately like some help. \n\nConclusion\u2014\n\nWe both think we are right and cannot think of a way to make the other person understand. Thanks for the help\n\n-- \u201cHoward\u201d and \u201cRene.\u201d", "I have a 11 month old baby. Super awesome little dude. I also have a 10 year old daughter from a previous marriage. I raised her as a single dad from 18 months to the present. \n\nI've been very careful to not tell my wife how to do things or how I did them in the past because she's excited to have the  experience of a baby and she's expressed things like \"you've done this before. This is my only chance to have a baby.\" (I got the snipsnip shortly after he was born). Basically I don't want to Dadsplain parenting. \n\nThis has led to things that I personally think are potentially problematic (ie she won't do cry it out even though the doc said it's time) BUT I'm happy to let her have her way so long as lil dude is healthy and safe. (Yes we've talked about it and she knows where I stand on it. That's not what I'm worried about being an asshole about) \n\nSo the other day, I'm putting his shoes on and she tells me, \"be sure they're on the right feet.\" Or while giving him a bath \"be sure to clean his diaper area well.\" \n\nDUUUUUUUUUDE. I KNOOOOOOOOOOW.\n\n\nAnd it's been like that since the beginning. \"you've got to support his head.\" \" You swaddle him too tight\" ( I didnt. That shit's supposed to make then immobile).\n\nLike I said. I want her to enjoy the ride. But I kept a kid alive for a decade almost entirely by myself. I don't need to be told how to put a pair of shoes on a baby or any other obvious shit. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I told her \"you know I know what I'm doing, right?\"", "I was at a large grocery store yesterday and I walked up to the butcher area to ask for assistance but there was one person ahead of me. When the person finished, I was just about to ask the butcher my question when a woman cut in front of me and asked him, \"Hi, can you please help me in the freezer aisle?\" The butcher said \"yes\" and was about to follow her when I interjected, \"Sir, I was here first.\" I swear I saw an eye roll on his part but whatever.\n\nMoving on. I had a cart full of groceries and I stood in line to check out. There was a woman who was unloading her packed cart in front of me so I waited a few feet behind her because had I moved my cart forward, I would have been blocking the traffic for other customers to walk through. Then, I see the same woman, who cut me off in the butcher station, nonchalantly walk in front of me and then she proceeded to unload her items onto the conveyor belt. I told her, \"Excuse me, ma'am, I've been waiting here. I'm next in line.\" She gave me a smug look and said, \"Ha, if you're next, then why are you standing back there and not here??\" So I told her, \"Because I don't want to block the flow of traffic walking by but I AM NEXT.\"\n\nGuys, she continued to argue with me saying, \"Well....you should've moved forward\" and then CONTINUED to unload her groceries. Keep in mind that I am not a confrontational person. In my 44 years on this planet, I have never been in a fist fight, In fact, I used to be a major pushover. If I was 18, I may have told her, \"You're right, go ahead.\" Well, that's not what happened.\n\nI. SAW. RED. I YELLED at her, \"Listen lady, I'm a civilized person who takes others into consideration, UNLIKE YOU who probably doesn't give a shit would've blocked this entire area. Now put your things back into your cart NOW or I'm going to go over there and do it for you!\" Then, the kind lady that was originally in front of me, and had finally completed her transaction, took one look at her and said, \"Seriously? You need to move because she HAS been waiting.\" You'd think that she would have backed off? Nope. She continued to unload her groceries muttering that I should've been closer and not standing so far in the back.\n\nI yelled, \"I'm NOT going to tell you again. Get your shit and put it back into your basket or I'll go and do it myself. NOW.\" She then took a good look at me and started putting her things back in her cart and walked away. I would imagine that by this point, my eyes were crossing and my head was two seconds from spinning like the kid from the Exorcist. I can't remember the last time I've felt so angry.\n\nShe finally moved but she kept staring me down and I'm ashamed to tell you guys that I screamed \"WHAT THE F\\*\\*K ARE YOU LOOKING AT????????\" She finally looked away and as quick as this started, it ended. The nice lady that was in front of me patted me on my back and told me that she was impressed how I defended myself but to please calm down because I looked like I was about to pass out.\n\nI need to add that since the store was so packed and music was blaring, not many people witnessed what went down.  Only those within hearing range were able to witness this exchange.  I know....  No excuses.\n\nTo be honest, at this point in my life, I've let people walk all over me. If this had happened ten years ago, I would've let her go on ahead of me. Not now. I'm a jaded, middle aged woman who is not the one. Don't get me wrong, what came out of me yesterday felt like an out of body experience. I'm not a mean person. She just sparked something in me that threw me over the edge.\n\nEdit: This may or may not be relevant, but I'm a Mexican American and all of this occurred in Spanish. I am a fluent bilingual speaker but I usually speak English. I didn't even know that I could fight the way I did in Spanish. Believe me, if you guys knew how to speak Spanish, I would've written the exact exchange I had with this entitled twit in Spanish. I don't know why but when arguments happen in Spanish, it looks like a much bigger deal!! ha!\n\nEDIT:  I'm getting some flack from some who are calling me an asshole because I assumed that there wasn't a single person here that could speak or read in Spanish.  I know a lot of you can so  I translated this story into Spanish so it's somewhere within this thread.\n\nTL;DR: A lady cut line in front of me twice and I lost my marbles.", "Yesterday, I (24M) attended a party. There were many of my old friends there. One of the girls, 25?, was someone who I was close to growing up but lost contact with after.\n\nThe two of us reconnected and talked. She was drinking a bit, although I didn\u2019t. Later on, she was doing things like putting her arm around me, holding my hand, etc, which I stopped because I have a girlfriend and I told her so.\n\nThen, she asked, \u201cIf you weren\u2019t taken, I bet we\u2019d be together right now.\u201d It was a bold thing for her to say and I guess it must have been the alcohol talking. I just responded, \u201cNah don\u2019t think so.\u201d She was offended and asked me why. I just said \u201cyou\u2019re not my type\u201d. She asked me WHY she wasn\u2019t my type, and I was tired of her bugging me, so I said, \u201cYou\u2019re just not what I\u2019m attracted to.\u201d\n\nShe got mad at me. She said, \u201cOh I get it, you\u2019re attracted to coked up skeletons like your girlfriend.\u201d Referring to the fact that my girlfriend is tall and skinny. I got defensive and said, \u201cWell Im not attracted to fat basic bitches like you.\u201d Granted, she\u2019s not even fat, just thick/chunky. But she does overdo the spray tan and she looks like every basic girl ever. I guess a lot of guys are after that look but not me.\n\nShe called me a cunt and later her friends found her in the bathroom crying. People are villifying me but she practically pushed me to it, especially insulting my girlfriend like that. I stand by what I said though, and she should know that her words have consequences. AITA?", "On my birthday this year, I treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. After taxes, I had ~$34,000, so I\u2019ve put $7,500 into my wife\u2019s car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. I\u2019m planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, I plan to travel for the month of January and half of February across Asia and Europe. I\u2019ve never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to Disney World for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.\n\nWell yesterday my daughter Emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. I told her about how I\u2019m financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and Emily went quiet before saying \u201cinstead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt\u201d.\n\nI told her that I\u2019d be happy to co-sign loans for her, but I was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount I promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). She said even after paying that off, she\u2019s looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. \n\nI told her that really sucks, but reminded her that I offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn\u2019t want to \u201cmiss out on the prestige\u201d (she got into Dartmouth). I talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.\n\nShe\u2019s brought up how the 10k I gave Jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. She argued how it\u2019s not fair that I was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.\n\nI told her that he\u2019d be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. Ultimately, the line I drew was that both children get equal amounts and I can choose how I want to spend my money, end of discussion.\n\nI thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife Amy about it behind my back. Amy tried to \u201cpersuade\u201d me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months I had planned. I told her the same thing that I told our daughter, and then SHE then got mad and said that I\u2019m being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount I put into *her* car AND the fact that she used ALL of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). I told her this vacation was non-negotiable.\n\nNow I have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. I feel like they\u2019re both acting entitled to MY shit; am I really being unreasonable here?\n\nEDIT I'm not leaving my wife behind; she can go for 10 days. She can't take the full 1.5 months off, though.", "To sum up the entire story as quickly as possible. I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rights to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.", "My friend, we\u2019ll call her Bridget, is one of those \u201cnot like other girls\u201d people. She makes those posts on Facebook, talks about it, etc. It can get a bit annoying, but the biggest issue I have with it, is that she \u201chas no filter\u201d. Now, I\u2019m all for speaking your mind because free speech and all of that. But there are times when you need to have a filter. She\u2019s the type to point out when things are awkward between two people, but they\u2019re pretending to be civil for the sake of the group and just get through this outing, before they don\u2019t have to see each other again. Doesn\u2019t happen often, but it\u2019s happened a couple of times when people have had an argument or don\u2019t like each other and then things are even more awkward.\n\nIf someone is on their phone a bit, she\u2019ll wave her hand in front of their face and say \u201cHey there\u201d and then call them on it. If they have a fashion sense that\u2019s odd to her, she\u2019ll make fun of them, even if they ask her to stop. She\u2019ll also tell you really random, graphic stories about her past, the same ones over and over. It\u2019s sad the first time, but your cocktail anecdote should not be \u201cMy house burned down when I was 11 and my uncles died two days apart, plus I think they haunt me.\u201d (The uncles didn\u2019t die related to the fire, they died of terrible diseases and these are tragic stories, and I\u2019m sorry they happened, btw, I\u2019m not trying to make light of it.) It makes people feel awkward, which you guess it\u2026she calls them on and laughs about.\n\nIf you call her out on any of this, \u201cI have no filter\u201d. A lot of our friends don\u2019t like this, but a bulk of them (including myself for a bit until she did this with me for way to long about the clothes) chalk it up to \u201cThat\u2019s just Bridget\u201d.\n\nThe other night, we were all hanging out and one of the guys had brought his new girlfriend. We were all talking about fairly, light, funny topics. Suddenly, Bridget brings up her uncles and started talking about their sickness, in excruciating detail. I can tell that the new girlfriend was getting pretty weirded out and I told her \u201cHey, maybe we can talk about the time they took you fishing. That\u2019s a funny one.\u201d \n\nBut no, she continued until she was done. Then the room got quiet, as it always does after she tells this horrible, awful story about two men dying of cancer and she looks around, bursts into laughter and goes \u201cWell, now none of you have anything to say.\u201d\n\nOur friend\u2019s new girl looks humiliated and I just feel so bad for her. I say, \u201cBridget, you need to cut this out. If you keep this up, people are going to stop inviting you to hang out with us. No one likes the way you talk to them. We\u2019ve told you in the past.\u201d She looked incredibly hurt and I said \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have a filter.\u201d\n\nApparently, Bridget is still incredibly hurt and thinks I\u2019m an ass. I do feel a bit bad, but at the same time, I am just sick of how she treats us as a group. Am I being an ass here?", "Hello, long time follower, first time poster. So my boyfriend knows that I have a lot of body image issues. I am a little overweight, and I struggle with it. I\u2019ve tried a myriad of different diet plans and exercise routines over the years, but nothing seems to stick. My boyfriend and I both really want to have a big family, and I\u2019ve confided in him before that I can\u2019t wait to have a baby, but the thought of being pregnant gives me a lot of anxiety because I don\u2019t want to gain weight.\n\nSo last night he calls me out of the blue, and says he just wanted to say \u201cI love you so much, and I can\u2019t wait to marry you and have babies with you because you\u2019ll make such a wonderful mother...\u201d and my heart is so full hearing this, and then he goes \u201c...but I can\u2019t have you go and ballooning up each pregnancy. You\u2019ll be 300 pounds by the time we\u2019re done having kids, and I\u2019m not having sex with no big fat slob\u201d and when I pushed back, he doubled down and set me guidelines of how much weight I am allowed to gain each pregnancy, and that after birth, I\u2019ll get one month to \u201crelax\u201d, then two months to get back to my pre-baby weight, and then I\u2019ll get pregnant again, and repeat.  \n\nSo we fought about it. I said he was being insensitive, and treating me like a sex-and-baby machine and not a human being. He tried to say he was only worried about my health (his dad died when he was a child from diabetes) and I was okay with that argument, but in trying to explain his health concerns, he kept digressing into such gems as: \nI\u2019m not gonna stay married to you if i don\u2019t get hard looking at you\nDo you want our kids to be embarrassed by you? Do you want them to say \u201cdaddy, can you drop us off as school instead of mommy, because the other kids make fun of the way mommy waddles?\nI love you, but my love is conditional, and the condition is not gaining more than 30 pounds. When the scale hits 31, I\u2019m signing the divorce papers.\nIf you told me not to weigh 300 lbs, I\u2019d say \u201csure thing, babe, you\u2019re right\u201d but the fact that you won\u2019t agree to it means that you must actually WANT to weigh 300 lbs, so if that\u2019s your goal, good luck but we\u2019re breaking up if that\u2019s what you want\nDo you want our kids to be fat fucks too? You want to give them insulin shots in kindergarten because you and the babies sit on the couch all day feeding each other Ding Dongs? \n\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of fights in the past around my boyfriend being blunt by nature, and me being overly sensitive by nature, but I really think he was out of line. And the whole conversation came out of nowhere, which really makes me feel like my weight is something that was just eating away at him and he had to get it off his chest. But should I just let it go if he insists he\u2019s only worried about my health? With his family history, it\u2019s understandable that he\u2019d worry about obesity and have a bit of a complex around it, and he is insisting that he\u2019s not asking for too much so I should just agree to it since gaining minimal weight is also what I want, so I shouldn\u2019t fight him and we just be in agreement?\n\n", "Ex and I divorced 8 years ago.  We have two kids together. My son in 16, turning 17 very soon.  \n\nMy ex wife has always publicly said that the break up was mutual.  Lately however I found out she had been telling both my kids that I left her and didn\u2019t give her the chance to continue the relationship. \n\nMy son was upset with me about it.  My daughter couldn\u2019t care less as far as I could tell. \n\nSo I took my son alone and told him that his mother had always been lying to him. That she cheated on me and that was what ended our relationship.  \n\nI haven\u2019t even heard from the ex yet and I\u2019m already feeling like I did something wrong.   All I did was tell him the truth.  And only in response to her lies. ", "First time poster here and I\u2019m on mobile so I hope this goes well. Anyways, let\u2019s jump right in to the stank!\n\nMe (24M) and my girlfriend (24F) had a baby boy one month ago today, and things have been pretty awesome. We\u2019ve really come together as a couple and our communication has been healthier than ever; even our levels of trust and little displays of affection are through the roof. All in all, a potentially stressful and chaotic situation worked out pretty well! \n\nMy SO has a six year old boy from a high school fling. The father moved several states away when he found out about the kid, and has only been around two or three times, for no more than an hour each time. Her son knows I am not his father but for the last three years I have tried to reinforce the fact that I am his friend and he can always talk to me. We play basketball together and we go bowling every weekend, as long as he behaves in school that week, so I would think to think that we are pretty close. \n\nSo two days ago (Friday) after work, the three of us went bowling while my mother watched our newborn. As we\u2019re changing shoes, I notice a really gnarly odor akin to sour milk and garlic. I searched for the offensive smell and I realized it was my Gf\u2019s son\u2019s feet. When I leaned down to put all of our shoes underneath the table, I was about a foot away from him and couldn\u2019t help but notice he absolutely REEKED. I was a little boy once, so I shrugged it off and made a mental note to tell his mom later. \n\nAs luck would have it, she brought up to me a few minutes later how he got made fun of at school that day for smelling bad and how it hurt his feelings. Me being the idiot that I am immediately responded with, \u201cSO, it smells like he hasn\u2019t wiped his ass properly in days. Does he use soap in the shower? Did you ever show him how?\u201d To which she blushed and vehemently responded that it was not appropriate for her to bathe with her own son. \n\nNow that he\u2019s six, I kind of agree, but I wasn\u2019t born knowing how to properly clean my body, I had to be taught. I told her that I felt as if it was her job as the sole parent to teach her son hygiene, otherwise this problem will never go away. I also stated that with our son, the newborn, I would 100% be taking responsibility for his hygiene so that I knew it would get done. She started to tear up and got really angry with me, so we finished our first game of bowling and left. She\u2019s been pissed at me all weekend. AITA here? Should I have handled that better? Different?", "I've had this dog since I was a kid and he's getting on in years now, but he's still pretty spritely for his age. I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.", "I know this might be a very trivial issue for some people, but please hear me out. Also, I'm French, so my English is average at best.\n\nWe lost our 14 yo daughter to cancer( I don't want to discuss that here ) a couple of years ago. These two years have been very difficult for us. Though I've learned to cope up, nothing can ever replace her. \n\nMy wife attended a support group, where she ended up befriending another woman, whose 11yo daughter had the same cancer our daughter had and they became close friends. Her daughter survived. We are really happy for her. She and her daughter visit us sometimes. \n\nLast time, when her daughter was here, she came across my daughter's custom made neclace which I made for her( I'm a jewellery designer by profession ). She saw it in a small room in which we made a small memorial for our daughter. It has her pictures, belongings and all her favourite things. She really liked it and asked my wife about it. \n\nNow, after they left, my wife asked me if I can make the same one for the girl. My wife told me that the girl really liked the neclace and asked if she could have one. I told her that it was something I made for my daughter and I don't want to share that or make it for anyone. No one can replace her. My wife thinks that our daughter would be really happy if we shared her memory with someone who had similar struggles and that I'm being selfish. AITA here?", "Background: My husband and I are both agnostic. Our child is 2 years old. We've agreed to introduce to her the cultural and historical aspects of major religions when fit (e.g. when we walk past a mosque and she gets curious. Not telling her anything complicated as of now because, you know, she's 2) and save the doctrines for when she's older. Our babysitter, I'll call her \"Emily\" here, has the patience of a saint, is very helpful and... religious. \n\nWhen Emily mentioned her religion during our interview, I made it crystal clear that we will respect that, but I also expect her to respect our wishes regarding religions. I gave her some guidelines like no doctrine-embedded stories (e.g. we're all damned because our ancestors decided to eat an apple), no teaching of doctrines etc. Emily understandingly obliged, or so we thought.\n\nOne day I came home early and caught her telling my child the story of creation of the world. I explained to Emily in private that it contradicts what we've been telling her, you know, dinosaurs and such, and reminded her of our agreement. She apologized. I dropped it at that. Yesterday I found out she's been reading to my child religious books for kids that basically tell their readers  to pray to and obey some deity. Not cool. \n\nNow I want to fire Emily because of the religious teaching behind my back, but my husband disagrees. He thinks what's important here is that Emily takes good care of our child, and considering that she spends at most 20 hours a week with her, it shouldn't be too hard for us to \"undo\" the religion part. I told him that a friend's child came home calling their parents sinners after two Sunday school classes so 20 hours a week isn't as trivial as he thinks. He says I'm overreacting and would look really bad if I fire Emily over this issue. Plus, our child has bonded with her already, so replacing her would do our child a disservice. I want to respect my husband's opinions but I'm starting to resent Emily. So reddit, would I be the asshole if I fire her?", "  \n\nI am a teenage girl living in Italy with extremely religious parents, and a now 26 week pregnant 14 year old sister.\n\nMy parents raised us with no knowledge of sex, and did everything they could to ensure that we couldn't learn about sex in school (such as removing us from school in days sex education was performed, and going as far as to remove me from class whenever I had biology in my later school years in case I got any ideas), and they never told us about it either. We were always taught that sex is for married couples who want to have children, and so the only real knowledge of sex I had was from my friends and media.\n\nMy parents think I am still a virgin despite being with my current boyfriend for two years, but this is not true. As they never found out about me having sex, I suppose my parents assumed their methods worked. However, last year, my sister (who is much braver than I was) came home to my parents and said she had a boyfriend. They got extremely angry, but knowing they couldn't really stop her seeing him without pulling her out of that school, accepted it somewhat.\n\nMy sister's boyfriend does not come from a religious background. I know his family well as I am friends with his older sister and they are very liberal.\n\nMy little sister and I share a room, and long story short, I found condoms in her pocket when I was tidying her clothes up. I asked her about it, and she told me they had been having sex for months with the condoms. I'm still pretty uneducated on sex due to my upbringing, but I have also been using condoms only for years so I - perhaps stupidly - assumed she would be fine and decided not to tell my parents. She is of age here and he is a nice boy, so I assumed it was fine.\n\nThis was a while ago, and I recently came home to a huge argument going on in my house. My parents had found out that my little sister is pregnant, and she has somehow been hiding it for all this time. My parents were going crazy at her, making her cry and simultaneously telling her she is stupid for getting pregnant but also that giving away the baby be wrong. My mother also claimed that an abortion would never be an option, to which my sister said she was too far along anyway. As far as I am aware, abortions are not permitted after the first trimester. At this point, my mother changed her mind and decided that my sister absolutely should have had an abortion. It was a huge mess in which I mainly stood aside. My mother eventually asked my opinion, and I replied:\n\n\"I think it's entirely your fault she is pregnant, you actively prevented her from knowing how to have safe sex and ultimately this child should be your responsibility, you have failed her and are abusing her for it.\"\n\nMy whole family are now angry at me, and along with this I shared that I had sex at her age and the way they raised us made us deceitful. Now everyone is angry at each other apart from me and my sister, and I can't help feeling like my input made it worse.", "Let\u2019s start by saying I don\u2019t have a lot of friends.

Two of the people we went out with work at other branches of the same chain. We all ate our meals and had a great time, but after we all left my boyfriend was in a real mood. We were heading to a bar to get some drinks and out of nowhere he just snapped 'I think it's absolutely disgusting that not one of you left a tip, do you know how much those wait staff earn?'. One of my friends who works at another branch said 'Over \u00a38 an hour?' (a couple of pounds above minimum wage) and he just sulked. When we got home that night he was still moody, and I tried to explain to him that we just don't really tip here very often because the servers get paid hourly. He thinks it's disgusting.\n\nHe also has an issue with me just being on the pill. In England, people in committed relationships with no STDs tend to just use one form of contraception **(note: I'm not looking for judgement on whether these norms are right or not)** and for me, my preferred one is the pill. He went crazy about this, saying that we have to use condoms (changed his mind later that night when he wanted sex) and where he's from taking just the pill is 'begging to be pregnant'.\n\nHe does things like this a lot. There's smaller examples, like getting pissed off when my brother (who is 18, legal age to drink here) drinks alcohol in front of him. My sister is at university and he refuses to call it anything but 'college' when college here is something you do before you're able to go to uni (and is typically, at least in my part of the UK, seen as something less academic students do).\n\nI know that he's being rude and I'm not the asshole for that, but we recently had a fight about it in which I declared 'if the only thing you like about this country is the free healthcare and that they speak English, you should fuck off'. Since then, he's been really upset. I don't think he knows how annoying he was.

Last night they were being exceptionally loud and when I asked them to keep it down, she insisted that I couldn't hear anything.

In addition, my friend told me that I should give him the benefit of being disabled where videochatting is often the easiest way of communication...", "I'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  \n\nHowever, despite being a \"supporter,\" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, \"You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!\" or \"You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha.\" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was \"struggling with my weight\" and then proceed to tell me that I look \"way too skinny to be healthy.\" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to \"look like a man's.\" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.\n\nThese hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. \n\nFinally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, \"Maybe he's into curvier girls.\" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. \n\nShe called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends.

He told me that this Russian guy did sign language videochat the whole night through with his parents. I asked my friend if he had the impression that it were an emergency, but he said that their chat seemed very lighthearted and included lots of laughing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I don't know what to do. The bill is over 60 bucks, my budget doesn't really allow it. And I told the deaf guy in advance to only use WhatsApp, but I didn't get a warning that he was using so much data, so he maybe didn't even realize it. In addition, my friend told me that I should give him the benefit of being disabled where videochatting is often the easiest way of communication...", "Okay, so here\u2019s the story.\n\n\u00a0\nWhen my old car broke down, my grandma gave me hers. It\u2019s a 2014 Honda Accord, and the thing has basically just been sitting in her garage for the past 5 years. It\u2019s in mint condition, and has crazy low mileage.\n\n\u00a0\nNow, my coworker, \u201cLouis\u201d, has always kind of given me the creeps. He\u2019s in his late 40\u2019s, but goes around hitting on all the girls in the office that are in their 20\u2019s. He just has this totally fake vibe about him, and I\u2019ve just tried to stay as far away from him as I can.\n\u00a0\nWhen I rolled up in my new car, he absolutely lost him mind. He starts asking me all the specs, details, other car stuff. Then he asks me if he can take it for a test drive. I tell him absolutely not. Honestly, who even asks that?\n\u00a0\n\nLater, I come out and he is inspecting my car, running his hands all over it. I asked him wtf he was doing, and he said he was just making sure I got a good buy. He then asks if I can let him inside so that he can see the interior. I said, and I quote \u201cLouis, No. Don\u2019t touch my car, don\u2019t look at my car, you\u2019re never going inside of it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nNow, if it couldn\u2019t get any worse, he brought a bag of candies to work. He was trying to give some to me. I said no. When I got out to my car, he had taken them out of the packaging and laid them out all over the hood of my freaking car. Since it was hot, they got sticky (edit to clarify: didn't fully melt but got really sticky and gross) and I had to take my car to the wash. I honestly feel like I\u2019m in the freaking twilight zone at this point.\n\n\nHe came in to my office this morning and started making more jokes about taking my car. I got up, without saying a word, and left my own office. Now I\u2019m wondering, WIBTA for taking this up with HR?\n\nEdit/Some clarifying information: This happened on work property. We have assigned spots, he is next to me. I didn't take any pictures of the candy (although I should have). I have no clue how long it actually sat on my car for, but it wasn't really melted. Just partially melted/a bit sticky.", "I know you're technically not supposed to do that but the bride of this one wanted a different type of wedding. She wore a black dress to the wedding and I knew beforehand she'd do this. I literally wore a cheap, white summer dress and all the girls were making petty comments about me throughout the night. \n\nOne of the bridesmaids walked up to me, a disgusted look on her face and says \"dont you know you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding?\"\n\nI responded with, \"for fucks sakes thats only so you dont upstage the bride! Shes wearing black!\" To be fair, I shouldn't have been so mean about it but for hours these girls had been staring at me, giving me nasty eyes and making comments about me. I dont even think the bride cared, she seemed to enamored by her husband to be aware of anything else  \n\naita?\n\n*UPDATE: apologized to the bride for wearing white, she says she didn't care. Case closed.*", "I left my GFs apartment to pick up my nephew who was staying for the night, and to pick up some food. Coming back, as I'm driving in, I make a wrong turn because its a new place, so I took the long way to her unit. I'm definitely driving a bit slower than usual traffic because everything is still new to me, plus there are a bunch of speed bumps and my car is lower. A cop followed me as soon as I turned in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I parked, I texted my GF that a cop was following me. I get our stuff when he cuts the spotlight on me and turns on his lights. By this time we're already out of the car. He walks up to me and asks me what I'm doing. In general, my philosophy is to say very little to police when I'm approached in an official capacity. I've had some run-ins before, and my nephew has priors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI responded matter of factly, \"Nothing really. You?\" I thought it was a friendly conversation. Thats my normal response to anyone asking me that question. He tells me he's the one that asks the questions, not me. OK. I'm also the one that doesn't answer questions so if we want to go that route. He asks me why I went the wrong way, and why was I driving so slow. I just say that I don't agree with the premise, and that neither one of those things are crimes. He says, \"What are you, a sovereign citizen? Give me your ID.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy this time, he's been shining his flashlight inside my car looking for shit. My GF is out front, and due to his lights 2 sets of neighbors are also out front. I state that again, I didn't commit a crime and since this isn't a stop and ID state I don't have to ID myself. I wasn't pulled over, I was approached after I was already parked. He says he got a call that someone who fit my description and matched my car was driving around the parking lot looking inside of cars, there was a recent car theft in that lot. He literally started following me the second I pulled in, which was 2 minutes ago, so I know thats bullshit. My GF speaks up to say something, and I tell her I've got this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe then turns to my nephew and demands ID. I tell him that he's a minor, and I don't give him permission to speak to him. I say that lets not act like he didn't run my plates, so we both know he knows who I am, and unless I'm being detained, I'm leaving. I walk inside and make sure they both follow me. Nothing else happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's really upset that I would speak to the police in that manner, especially considering they have had some minor crime recently. I was never rude, I just don't want to answer a bunch of questions. She's also highly embarrassed that I would do this in front of her neighbors. Do what? I'm not the one that turned the discussion sideways, and I'm not the one that started lying. Also, we're Black while my GF and her apartment complex is all White. That may have something to do with how I've experienced police encounters versus how she has.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  They've had a couple of car break-ins, and 1 home break-in within the past 2 months or so.  They put a cop on site for nights like this.  GF insists its just for security, and its the same as having to check-in at the front in a gated community.  Lots of people have apparently been questioned, and all you have to do is tell them where you're going and give them your ID.  Although I'm glad they're being proactive, I still feel like I didn't sign up for all of that.", "My wife is five months pregnant with our first child. Recently, she has felt some small kicks from the baby. I tried to feel for a few nights, but no kicking. Then on Saturday, my best friend was over playing games with the two of us. We started talking baby stuff, and my wife mentioned that the baby has started kicking. My friend, who was very happy and excited, asked if he could feel her belly, and she said, \"No, but I appreciate you asking.\" My friend was visibly upset/discouraged, but we moved on. My friend slept over after having a few drinks, but after he left the next morning, my wife and I talked about it and I told her that I was upset that she didn't let my friend feel her belly. She said that it was her body and she didn't want anyone but her mom or me touching her belly. So I told her that I will not be touching her belly and that that was my choice and I thought she was being unfair to not let my friend (30 and single) experience that life growing inside of her. She cried a lot and we talked a lot more, but it just seems selfish to me. Am I the asshole here?\nTLDR: Wife didn't let my friend feel her pregnant belly, so I decided that I would not be feeling her pregnant belly.\n\nUpdate : Looks like I am an asshole. I'm at work and texted her that I'm excited to feel our baby and that I'm sorry for being an asshole.\n\nUpdate 2: While I completely do understand that I was being immature and petty, many people are calling my friend a perv. I think it's a very normal desire to want to feel a baby kick in the womb? Also, all clothes were on. At no point did he ask to feel her bare belly. \nI now understand that I have no say in who is allowed to touch her belly and who is not allowed.\n\nUpdate 3: Not sure if it is at all relevant, but my wife went back home for the week (before any of this happened) and my sister was the first person to feel baby's kicks, after my wife invited her to feel. My wife and I hadn't had the conversation of who is allowed to feel and who is not allowed to feel, so I figured if my sister was allowed, then our friend would be allowed. I shouldn't have assumed, but that was my line of thinking.\n\nUpdate 4: just got home from work, got her a big bouquet of flowers and sat down and hugged her and tried to feel baby. We talked about it and I texted her the link to the post. I told her I was stupid and that I fucked up big time and that I was very sorry. She accepted my apology and she's getting ready for work while I make her breakfast.\n\nFinal update : I did hear you all loud and clear. Fuck me, yes I'm the asshole here. To be honest, I was very excited that our friend was excited for us. I was then just discouraged that it seemed like he was being stifled. But my wife felt uncomfortable. That's that. End of story. I should've been fully supportive of her wishes in this situation and I wasn't. We're 4 years into a very young relationship (I'm 22, she's 21). I know that I have a ton of growing to do and I get that I fucked up here. I'm trying my best and sometimes my best sucks ass. I'm trying to be excited for this baby (I'm mainly terrified), and I fucked up. Thank you for showing me what needed to change.", "My friend and his gf of a few months came by for dinner and drinks this weekend along with my fiance and a couple other mutual friends. At some point I took off my wedding and engagement rings so I can cook and get chicken all over my hands (salmonella is bad kids) without worrying about them. After we eat and dishes are placed in the sink I reach blindly for my rings  since I always put them in a specific notch in the counter and only feel one.\n\nCue panic. I asked everyone if they've seen the wedding band anywhere or if it got knocked off the counter and it got to a point where I was on all fours on the ground hyperventilating while me and our friends searched.\n\nI showed them all a picture of it in case and the gf goes \"oh that thing? I thought it was foil I threw it away!\"\n\nRecord scratch. Dafuq? Everyone was staring at her and I'm pretty sure my face was changing colors more rapidly than metal under a blowtorch. She starts giggling and points at the trash. The trash is about half full of food prep stuff and puppy pads because we have a disabled French bulldog that literally cant control his bowels so yeah. Pads.\n\n\"What it was an honest mistake! You left it with the other food stuffs and I was just trying to help!\"\n\nI asked if she was serious and she shrugged and repeated that it was just a mistake and the ring would most likely be sitting on top of everything. Cursory glance said nope. My saint SO offers to dig it out and I was too furious to say anything so I just nodded and glared at her. My friend (the bf) helps him too and they do end up finding it after nearly puking from the dog doo. After they wash it off they place it on a towel to dry and the gf still kept saying that she accidentally mistook it for foil.\n\nI turn to her and in a calmness that afterwards left me shaking and lightheaded said \"You need to leave now, before I crush your face because I ACCIDENTALLY mistook you for cockroach.\"\n\nMy friend and her gasp and our other friends kinda stared at each other and back at me.\n\nGf bursts into tears and storms out. My friend follows her after an angry glare at me. Our other friends told me I took it too far and maybe she was just playing a prank etc. They even mentioned that it was because my wedding band was not that expensive it wouldn't have been a big deal if we lost it. My SO asks them to leave too as I am about to lay the wrath of God into them.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole here? Did I overreact?\n\n**Tldr friends gf throws my ring away \"accidentally\" so I tell her to gtfo before accidentally confusing her for a cockroach.**\n\n**Edit: lots of comments to muddle thru so I'll add one here.**\n\nThank you to all the comments even the ones saying iata. I recognize that threatening violence was not okay and I regret that part but if I'm an asshole for comparing her to a disgusting pest I don't want to be right.\n\nSome clarity as well - she NEVER apologized which is why I dont think it was accidental. She was chuckling and snorting while my SO and her bf dug through dog shit and food peels. She knew she fucked up because she didn't make eye contact with me at all while they were doing it either. Even her bf doesn't think it was accidental after I talked to him today, but that it was harmless and we didn't really lose the ring and I shouldn't have called her a cockroach.\n\nThe ring, although inexpensive is sparkly and does not look like foil. It was absolutely insulting that my friends thought it was a non issue that they thought that I can just buy a new one if I had actually lost it. I'll post a picture in a bit to clear up confusion.\n\nEdit 2: my engagement and wedding band [http://imgur.com/a/YR9rkxh](http://imgur.com/a/YR9rkxh)\n\nEdit 3: last edit for the night Here are the rings put together: [http://imgur.com/a/zqfKYr1](http://imgur.com/a/zqfKYr1)\n\nThank you to everyone with different perspectives. I'll say it again, I shouldn't have threatened her, yes it was in the heat of the moment but her smug laughing face pushed me over the edge. Not an excuse. Maybe I'm biased to not think my ring separately looks like foil but really its seeming less and less of a mistake when you consider that putting foil in compost makes no sense. She could've tossed it in the other two bins but she put it in the one we told them only food scraps and biological wet trash goes into. Like they've been to our house before. The bf is still going to be my friend since honestly I don't blame him for the things she chose to do. That's her agency. Not my problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 4 FINAL EDIT. (will be adding to this as I read through)\n\nI have read through most-ish of the comments so I will try and answer multiples of questions here and also some clarifications.\n\n1. *Why are you wearing your wedding ring if you're just engaged?* \\- My fiance and I went shopping for wedding bands together after he gave me the engagement ring. When we found one that remotely fits, we took it home and pried it open wide enough to fit the engagement ring, and I wanted to wear it already and he agreed.\n2. I am also a girl, they were at my house.\n3. *Why is there poo in the kitchen trash?* \\- We have 3 bins in the house. 2 of them are open air, one for recycling, the other for non-recycling. The poo pad + compost bin is metal and covered and double bagged. We've had our disabled dog for around 6 months and this is the method that has worked for us because it's a hassle to run outside with drippy poo pee pads 3-5 times a day.\n4. I recognize IATA for threatening violence. I do not feel bad about calling her a cockroach.\n5. *Why are you focusing your question on calling her a cockroach when you should be asking about the \"crushing her face\" deal?* \\- At the time, and even now, our friends thought that the cockroach bit and telling her to leave was the bit that went too far.\n6. *How do you know she did it on purpose?* \\- She still hasn't apologized, even if it was accidental. She did not throw anything else away because I throw everything I don't need away as I cook. She has been to my house many times. She has seen my rings together on my finger often. **Also, if she accidentally threw away some 'foil' she wouldn't have recognized that she did from seeing the picture.**\n7. *But you found it so why are you still making a big deal about it?* \\- If I didn't reach for my rings at the time and they left after dinner, we would have thrown away the bin and it would have been lost forever.\n8. Thank you to all the people that say my rings are beautiful.\n9. I didn't even realize the title said \"it\" until this morning, sorry about that.\n10. *Why do they even know the value of the ring?* \\- We found them separately on Etsy and got both pieces for a bargain and bragged about it when we got them.\n11. *What is the stone in the engagement ring? -* Alexandrite. It changes color depending on ambient lighting.\n12. We will be investing in a ring saucer to place my rings in when cooking to mitigate any future incidents.\n13. *How long have you known these people? -* The GF has been around for 7-8 months and we have hung out many many times before and during my engagement. The BF has been a close friend for around 10 years and no, I am not cutting him out. The other 2 guests are acquaintances that I've known for about a year. \n\nI am pretty sure I missed something else but [here is the dog tax of Jackson](https://imgur.com/gallery/8Bol5WA) that some of the people have asked for. I will keep trying to respond to the comments but this really blew up. Thank you for your perspectives.\n\nAlso, to the people saying it's fake because my writing style is too well thought out, or that I have great grammar... Thanks I guess?", "I'm getting a lot of flack from my wife for being visibly upset at this woman and I am currently in a state of being where I just don't want to be around her right now. \n\nThis woman had a rebound relationship and got pregnant. She told my wife that she preferred to go condomless and, wouldn't you know it, when she missed her period, she insisted there was NO WAY she could be pregnant. \n\nMy wife and I had a feeling after her third missed week that she was pregnant. At work, she asked her, \n\n\"If you *are* pregnant, are you thinking of getting an abortion?\"\n\nThe friend responded, \"ABSOLUTELY NOT. I would literally NEVER do that. If *anything*, adoption.\"\n\nRelieved, we offered to take her child. We realized that it was financially difficult for her so we even offered to help her out money-wise as well as emotional and familial support before and after the baby was born. I'll let it be known that she actually made us believe that if she *were* pregnant, we'd adopt it. This got me emotionally attached to the idea because she said that, at the very bottom line, she'd never ever even think about abortion.\n\nIt got brought up weekly for about a month (they're really close, this wasn't intruding- just causal conversation) until she went silent. We didn't hear from her for about 10 days. She sends my wife a text and says she got an abortion.\n\nWhile I understand her fear (and realistically I *don't* fully understand since I'm a guy), I feel like I got bait-and-switched with a potential child of mine. I know it wasn't mine, but the reason I'm so upset is because she actually had us believing that this child could have been a part of our lives. This goes beyond an abortion debate. It got real and emotional investment happened. \n\nI have a hard time seeing her, so when she comes over, my wife intentionally keeps distance by hanging out with her on the porch while I go work or hangout in the basement. I understand she's probably hurt to, but I feel hurt to, and I just need time to get to a place where I can be civil and polite, because right now, in my heart, I'm not.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI think people are misreading, or maybe I wrote it poorly. Here was our outlook.\n\na. If she wants to keep the pregnancy, we will be there for emotional support and, since she's single and not really established, financial support. We would first to just be helpers, not trying to steal anyone's baby here. \n\nb. If she didn't want to keep the baby because of financial stress and emotional toll, we would gladly give it a home.\n\nSince she was clearly against abortion, we thought those were the two best options to keep the baby in a stable environment.\n\n**DOUBLE EDIT THIS BLEW UP**\nBy asking if IATA, I want to make *very clear* that I am NOT inferring that she ITA. Thanks!", "My friend recently uploaded a facebook video of her kid running around her yard and playing in her pool.  It was a typical home video type of thing. I personally have nothing wrong with the kid being naked in the privacy of their own home, but I felt like seeing close up shots of the kids privates was something that my friend might regret having on the internet. It turned out her profile ended up getting banned for a week and now she is making a few facebook statuses about how people are rude. My wife said I should have just let it be. Am I the Asshole?", "Honestly don\u2019t think I acted assholish here given her actions, but the severe backlash I\u2019ve received has me open to the idea that I am. Hence I\u2019m posting here.\n\nTo cut a long story short, I slept with a girl called Madison at a toga party. We had both been drinking but not in anyway drunk. Just a couple beers. The next morning a friend approached me and asked why I slept with her when she has herpes. I had no idea and obviously would not have slept with her had I known. I was annoyed she did not disclose this and feel she had a moral obligation to do so before sleeping with anyone.\n\nWhen I confronted her she admitted she has genital herpes but said it wasn\u2019t a big deal, it never flares up, she hasn\u2019t passed it on to anyone etc. I don\u2019t really care for these excuses, and when I pushed her for an apology she said I was being a pansy.\n\nFollowing this incident, I took it upon myself to share her herpes status on our university\u2019s Facebook pages anonymously. I did this so that other men (or women, if she swings that way) don\u2019t get tricked also. Although it\u2019s obviously me that did it, she can\u2019t prove it, and I haven\u2019t gotten in trouble for it.\n\nThat said, she has organised a campaign against me for \u201cslut shaming\u201d and \u201charassment\u201d against her for the posts, and successfully convinced a few groups of my guilt. The posts in question were literally bland and vanilla: \u201cBeware of X. She has genital herpes and does not disclose this fact to those she sleeps with.\u201d Absolutely no mean words or slurs.", "Since this is a very specific situation, I\u2019m using a throwaway for privacy reasons. \n\n**Note - My friend has now said that although she is \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in my actions, she\u2019s going to drop the money issue.  So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m being sued or anything. I\u2019m just posting to see if I am in the wrong with how I handled things.**\n\nMy friend recently got this butt procedure done in Mexico for cosmetic reasons. I personally thought it was a little unnecessary but I try to be a good friend and support her regardless. \n\nShe ended up inviting me to come stay at a hotel with her for a week while she recovered. Then we would fly home together. I am a teacher and have summers off so I agreed to do it. There was no mention of money. (Because my husband happens for an airline, I hardly ever pay for flights, so the plane tickets were covered). \n\nI get there and the hotel suite my friend rented is beautiful. I have my own room and everything. But my friend was in no position to do much of anything. I had to basically play nurse as she couldn\u2019t even use the restroom on her own. Whenever I got a chance, I would try to eat out and go swimming or explore, but since my friend needed me, my time was limited. I managed to squeeze in one hike and that\u2019s it. Obviously, it was not exactly a traditional vacation for the reasons I\u2019ve outlined. \n\nOn our last day there, my friend asked me when I thought I could \u201cpay her back\u201d for half the cost of the suite. I\u2019m like uhhhh excuse me?? Why would I pay you to play mommy/nurse for seven days?? She was pissed and we got into a big argument which obviously ruined the end of the trip.\n\nMy husband thinks it\u2019s insane that she would ask me to pay her anything. However, a mutual friend of ours is on the side of the friend who had surgery. So I\u2019m starting to doubt myself. \n\nAm I somehow wrong to expect that she\u2019d cover the cost of the hotel under these circumstances? I mean, would you ask a friend to pay who spent time taking care of you?", "I am a father to 3 \u201cyoung adult\u201d (ages 18, 22 and 24) sons who live with me and who for the most part have always gotten along (normal brotherly fights but nothing serious). However throughout this summer I\u2019ve noticed a bit of a tension between them. I told my youngest to spill the beans since I figured the conflict was between the older two since they seemed the most tense. My youngest tired to avoid eye contact and kept trying to play dumb but I kept pushing. My eldest child had some bad history of impulsive behavior when he was a few years younger (the worst being an incident which resulted in his expulsion from college) but he had been slowly improving his life and I didn\u2019t want to be too late to help him if he had done something to jeopardize itI really didn\u2019t want my youngest keeping secrets.\n\nWhen I finally got the truth out I was in shock, it turns out that middle child gathered a baby (my granddaughter) over a year ago, but had refused to even see the child. My oldest found out since he happens to work with a cousin of the mother, and he has been trying to get his brother to take responsibility and be there for his child, but he has refused. \n\nI confronted my middle child and we got into a huge fight. He claimed that being a father would ruin his plans for life but I told him that he had to take responsibility for his own actions and that his child deserved to have a father in her life.\n\nThis went on for a while when I told him that if he didn\u2019t think his own child deserved a father then he didn\u2019t deserve a father himself and I told him that he had to leave the house. He is 22 years old and has a decent job and plenty of friends so I wasn\u2019t too worried about him. \n\nI have met my granddaughter and her family and have made some plans to sell my house and downsize to begin a college fund for her since my youngest child will go to college and my oldest has been saving up to move out. \n\nIt has been about a month now and while I feel like I made the correct decision, I still feel terrible. I chose to end my relationship with my son, which hurts so much, since I have always felt closest with him throughout his life (he had the same interests that I had and was the most willing to spend time with me) I feel horrible that I raised a kid who was willing to not care about a human he helped create, I feel like i ruined any chance of a relationship between him and my youngest son, and I feel guilty since my wife has been crying a lot the last few weeks and I don\u2019t know how to fix anything.\n\n\n\nAITA for this? Was my reaction too strong?\n\n\nEdit: He is also incredibly lackluster at paying his child support, he has to be told to do it and even then he is reluctant.\n\nEdit 2: a lot of people are getting upset about my reaction to the youngest child, however my oldest and youngest both have been trying to get him to own up on his own for months before I found out\n\nEdit 3: also I have seen my granddaughter more than once, selling my house is not a knee jerk reaction since I we have been think about it for over a month and still haven\u2019t made ANYTHING official (and my wife and I came up with this idea together )", "My boyfriend and I recently bought our first house. I want it to be clean and nice whenever anyone comes over. I don\u2019t think this is too much of an issue? \n\nA few days ago his parents turned up unannounced and let themselves in. I had just got out the bath and had to quickly run upstairs and get myself dressed as I was in a towel. The house was also messy due to laundry/just moving.\n\nThen today we were cleaning the house ready for someone coming round a bit later and his parents rang to say they are on there way and will be 5 minutes. (They live 30 mins away) My boyfriend told them that we were actually busy due to cleaning and someone coming over shortly could we do another time. His mother then sent him a page long essay on how she understands how it is now and he would be welcome to turn up whenever he wanted to her house and that one day someone won\u2019t be able to wait an hour or whatever to see us and we won\u2019t get the chance to see them again because something might happen to them. She quotes \u201cjust remember that\u201d \n\nAre we being the assholes here? \n\nI mean this is my house too and if I want to be able to make the house nice before someone comes or walk round the house in a towel or god forbid even naked why should I not be able to because someone may just turn up at my house at any moment? I mean seriously she can come once a day if she wants just please give us some warning.

Normally I don\u2019t give a shit but I was tired from the gym and I think exhaustion made me impulsive so I just plopped myself right next to her, onto her purse. She starts freaking out and yelling and pulls her purse right under my sweaty butt and goes to complain to the driver. Obviously, the driver doesn\u2019t give a shit and the lady comes huffing and puffing back alone demanding I leave the seats. So I just plopped my gym bag right onto the other seat. I normally don\u2019t stand up for myself but I think the obnoxious nature of this lady made me use her moves against her. Do you think It\u2019s an Asshole move?", "A bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.", " \n\nThere are three children, elementary aged, that live on my street, two a couple houses down from me, the other across the street from them. They are constantly running into the road to cross, or after something, or riding some toy down the middle (bike, three-wheeler, scooter). As such I creep down my road past their house to get to mine. Like, 10-15 mph with the clutch in and my foot hovering over the break. \n\nWell, about a week ago I am creeping along as the kids are riding bikes down the middle of the road. The youngest is in the middle of the road heading for me, but looking behind her to her brother. I realized that she isn\u2019t going to stop so, with cars on either side so I couldn\u2019t pull over, I come to a stop in the middle of the road. \n\nAs I am putting my car in reverse, she turns around and sees me. She swerves around me, and lets out a \u201cWhoa.\u201d I wait for the others to clear the road, and move past and park in my driveway. I was getting out of my car when the girl rides up behind my car. \u201cYou almost hit me!\u201d\n\nI calmly told her that no, she almost hit me, and that she and her brother are the reason why I got a dashcam. (There are other benefits, but the kids were my primary motivation.) She didn\u2019t understand, but then asked about my daughter (high school age) and if she was still in school because she\u2019s so old. \n\nI answered, and went inside thinking nothing more of it. About an hour later there is a hammering on my door. My husband answered to see the girl\u2019s mom. She sees me and starts screaming about how horrible I am that I told her daughter that I got a dashcam because of her and her brother. \n\nMy husband closed the door in her face and locked it. \n\nI recounted this to a coworker, and they said I\u2019m an asshole for telling the kid the truth even if it didn't bother the kid. I don\u2019t think so because the kids need to learn to have more awareness around the road. So I will accept my judgment.", "My wife has a younger brother (29) who has been in a relationship with his high school sweetheart (who's also a 29 year old male) for about 12 years. I think of both of them as my family, they're my children's uncles, we spend a bunch of time together and we get along great. I recently had a vasectomy, I'm 44, we have 3 kids and we aren't planning on having any more. After one Sunday lunch with our BILs, we sent the kids away and us adults had some drinks and started talking about my vasectomy. At one point, I said how great it was to finally not have to worry about protection, and how great it felt without it. And I said I almost feel sorry for them not experiencing it. My BIL laughed and said: What are you talking about, we haven't used protection since high school.\n\nI was going to reply something, but the kids came running in so I dropped the topic. I later thought about what he said and talked to my wife about it, saying that I don't think it's safe for them to be having sex without condoms, as a couple of gay men, and my wife laughed at me. Apparently, just because they've been together for a long time, it's safe? She told me to drop it and let them live their lives however they want.\n\nI thought it was ridiculous of her to have that reaction to her own brother not using protection and realized she wasn't going to tell them anything about it. So I figured I would buy some condoms and give them to my BILs and tell them I was worried about their safety and that they should really rethink not using protection.\n\nA couple of days ago, we had another lunch together, we sent the kids away again, and I gave them the condoms. I rehearsed a whole speech about how I wouldn't want anything to happen to them and that they should stay safe. But, rather than seeing my gesture for what it was - a gesture of care - they were offended. They asked if I am suggesting they shouldn't trust each other? They said they had never slept with anyone else their whole lives and if they managed to have an exciting enough sex life not to cheat on each other for 12 years, they'll probably manage the same in the future. And my wife's brother also said that, by the same token, I should be continuing to wear condoms despite having had a vasectomy. After shouting at me for 10 minutes, they just left. My wife has been incredibly mad with me and demanded I apologize to them, but I refuse to apologize for caring about their health and safety. I don't see how what I did was THIS horrible. They could have just declined the condoms. And their arguments are ridiculous. So what if they've been together for 12 years? People have cheated on each other after being together for longer than that.", "I am a married woman who was happily married up until a few days ago.  Recently my husband started talking about a new girl at work.  I thought, fine, I trust him, and he has other female friends.  \n\nSoon I noticed the way he talked about her was different.  He seemed really giddy, almost like when we were dating.  It bothered me a bit, partly because she is 19 and I am 36, but once again, I trusted him, so I left it alone.  \n\nOccasionally when he was texting her I would ask what they were talking about, and he gave me vague answers.  \n\nOne day I came home and found him talking on the phone with her.  This bothered me.  When he got off the phone I told him how much it bothered me.  I asked to see the messages between the two of them.   He said that they were private.  \n\nHe mentioned that the two of them had played a game where they guessed secrets about each other, and he gave his word not to show it to anyone.  I told him I felt this was too intimate of a conversation for \"friends\" to be having.  \n\nHe mentioned that she really didn't want her boyfriend to know they were talking.  Red flags went off in my mind.  I told him he needed to stop talking to her.  He refused, saying he didn't want to lose his friend.  \n\nEventually I decided to let the boyfriend know that they were talking and sharing secrets.   I figured I would want to know if I were him.  He said she had cheated on him multiple times before, and when he asked her about it she denied everything.   \n\nAfter all of that, they broke up.  She told my husband to stop talking to her, therefore ending their friendship, and my husband and I are in a weird space now.  Am I the asshole for ruining three relationships?", "During a long road trip I stopped off with my 4yo daughter for dinner at a family run rest stop type caf\u00e9/restaurant we\u2019ve been to many times before. My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe\u2019d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she\u2019d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she\u2019d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her \u201cdo you know you are really beautiful?\u201d She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn\u2019t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said \u201cthe man is talking to you\u201d he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn\u2019t like his tone or the look on his face, I\u2019ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice \u201cbeautiful\u201d inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn\u2019t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it\u2019s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI\u2019m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&#x200B;", "So, first of all....let me just tell you guys I am ugly.

She tells me I should feel good because I am 'definitely not the best looking guy on campus' and that they needed 10-15 more people to finish the video.\n\nI was honestly indifferent at the ugly part because I was used to it but this felt like a shitty thing but I didn't want other guys to go through it and cameras were technically not allowed so I reported to the campus authorities about it and they have banned anyone from their channel from shooting videos at our university again.\n\nHonest opinion would be appreciated!

My husband and his family are originally from Ohio (we live in Utah) and his family has started moving out here for a fresh start. Almost immediately after buying our house his younger brother moved in with us and has been here for about eight months; he\u2019s a great roommate and pulls his weight around the house. About 2 months ago my SIL decided she needed a new start and she moved in with us (also a great roommate) now that my husband and his two siblings are living here his parents decided to move here also. I work from home and keep my home office for myself to get work done. When my in laws asked about moving down here my whole household was thrilled. When I then asked \u201cWho\u2019s giving up their bedroom?\u201d Everyone just went silent. I unfortunately had to pull rank on everyone and put my foot down and say I was keeping my office as of right now no one is speaking to me.\n\n\n\nTo make some clarifications since I have been asked. \n\nYes BIL and SIL Pay rent.

Yes, I am a man. \n\n\n*Hubs and I just made it clear BIL AND SIL have until September to be out. No in laws moving in.*", "I dated my ex for 3 years and ended up finding out she was cheating for about half of that time. I broke up with her about 4 months ago and she moved out of my house. I ended up hearing from friends that she was painting me as the bad guy who drove her into the beds of all those guys she cheated with. No one believed her and she ended up isolating herself from the friend group because people really didn\u2019t like the way she handled things as far as cheating and with the break up.\n\nHer parents recently were killed in a bad car accident. It\u2019s a shame, they were very good people. I enjoyed the time I spent around them and they treated me well. They died about 5 days ago. \n\nMy friends have been telling me over the past few days that she was asking about me and saying she wishes she could be with me and talk to me about the loss and apologize. \n\nI don\u2019t buy the bullshit. This isn\u2019t about her being sincerely remorseful about anything. This is her wanting to manipulate me into emotionally supporting her through this. Her parents dying sucks and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s awful to deal with, but it is firmly her problem, not mine. \n\nI told my friends this and they said they\u2019d soften it but make sure she knows I\u2019m not the one she should be calling or coming to.\n\nShe came over to my house early this morning a mess and crying and apologizing and begging at my doorstep. I thought about what I\u2019d say but everything was going to be needlessly cruel so I just shut the door and she screamed so loud and for so long my neighbors called the police.\n\nI didn\u2019t get in trouble or anything but it was embarrassing and I had to deal with explaining things to them(it sure was fun explaining the context of her saying her parents were dead and crying on my doorstep). \n\nMy standing on this is pretty much that it sucks for her and more for her parents. But this isn\u2019t my job anymore\u2014to deal with supporting her through anything.", "Brother's wife (SIL) is pregnant with their first child and had a baby shower over the weekend. I was not invited to the shower but my brother sent me a gift registry. I didn't buy anything because I'm not invited so why should I buy a gift? My sil asked me what I got for her on Mon after the shower and I said I'm not getting anything. She teared up and asked me why. I simply said that I was not invited so I didn't think I need to buy a gift. I did buy a congrats on your baby card for them. \n\nMy brother is angry at me and my SIL is apparently really upset. SIL and I don't get along at all so they think I am doing this to be rude and retaliatory.  I think its rude to not invite guests to your baby shower but still expect them to get you a gift. My brother says I'm immediate family so the etiquette rules don't apply and I should not have said it so bluntly to his wife's face. I said I'm happy for him and his wife but I'm not getting a gift for them. Then I hung up.  \n\nThe rest of the family aren't getting in the middle of this and are just telling us to sort it amongst ourselves. What do you think? Aita?", "Just recently, our local Walmart and Target have begun to ask for receipts as patrons are leaving the store. At first I would oblige. I thought \"Whatever, it will only take a few seconds, NBD\". But as it happens more and more, I'm starting to realize not everyone is being asked to do this. Often times I'm having my groceries checked against my receipt as I watch multiple people walk right past us.\n\nI thought maybe they were just looking over receipts whenever possible. But one time the \"greeter\" wasn't busy with anyone else. I watched 4 or 5 shoppers walk right out without a word from her, but as I was about to leave, she asks me aside.\n\nAt this point I start thinking, I'm a young male shopping alone, maybe I'm being profiled. So, after she asks politely to see my receipt I respond with \"No thanks.\" and continue out of the store. She looked a little puzzled, but...\n\nWow, nothing happened. That's an awful lot more convenient than being \"nice\". So, that's been my default response for the past few weeks. A greeter asks me to provide my receipt and I say \"No Thanks/No/Nope/Nah/Maybe next time/etc.\" with no issues. That is, until last night.\n\nI was on my way home from work, when my roommate asks me to pick up a jar of peanut butter. So, I get to the store, find the peanut butter, ring myself up, pay, and make my way to the doors. As I'm leaving, an older man says \"Hold up! Let me see your receipt.\", to which I respond \"Nah.\", and continue on my way. He stands up from his chair, raising his voice just a little, and says \"You need to pay for that!\", and I respond \"I did, have a good night!\"\n\nThis is when it gets a little weird. He's clearly unconvinced, and begins to yell \"YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME YOUR RECEIPT!\" while following me out into the parking lot. I stop, turn around, and say \"I paid for this, it's my property now, transaction complete\". He just gets even angrier, demanding that I show him my receipt, yelling \"You have to pay for that\" and \"You have to show me your receipt\" non stop.\n\nEventually I make it to my car, which he proceeds to stand in front of. Now, he's saying he's going to call the police, yadda yadda. I roll down my window and tell him \"That's fine, you can call them, I don't mind. Can you get away from my car?\", and he responds \"Like hell I will!\" while slamming his hands onto the hood of my car.\n\nAt this point I just want to go home. I look around my car and there are no people or cars anywhere nearby. So I quickly reverse my car away from him, and high tail it out of there.\n\nAfter recounting this story to my roommates, they said I was a total prick about it. They think that since it would have only taken a second to confirm that I paid for the peanut butter, that means I should have just shown him my receipt and been done with it. \n\nBut I think that's bullshit. These stores shouldn't operate on the assumption that I'm a thief by default.\n\nSo, what does reddit think. AITA?", "Some side info: My sister has two children (4yo, 2yo) and is married. For the last 2 years the barely made it to the end of the month and all of the family know they struggle finacially. Me and my partner are doing well financially and have no kids.\n\nTwo weeks ago my sister called me and asked me to come visit her, since there was something very important she needed to tell me. When I arrived she immediatly broke down crying, telling me how she was pregnant again and she \"doesn't know what to do\". She didn't even tell her husband at that point and I was very surprised to be the first person to know, since we're not really close.\n\nAnyway she continued saying that they don't have the means to support another child with all the debt they already deal with. I tried to calm her as much as I could, saying that there will sure be some solution to handle the situation. After a while she told me she looked up how much abortions cost and that even if she wanted to, she could not pay for it at the time.\n\nSo I basically offered that if she decides to abort, I would take care of all medical bills coming from that procedure. She asked me if I could afford that, so I told her she does not have to worry. Since I don't use up all my money every month, I'm usually able to put some into savings and it was okay for me to put 2 of my mothly savings into her procedure, if she decides to have it.\n\nShe thanked me and told me that she needs time to think about it.\n\nFour days later she asked me to come visit again when her husband is home, so we could discuss how to go about it. I drove there at the same evening. They greeted me and her husband told me that he's really happy that I decided to help them in a tough time like that. She told me how she thought about what I said and she wanted to \"accept my offer\". However she didn't want the abortion but suggested that I should give them the money for the abortion as well as \"a little bit very month since I don't spend all my money anyway\". I was pretty much bewildered. I did not offer that. I told them straight forward that I will only give them money for the procedure, but won't be financially supporting them in any other way. Her husband blew up, telling me I'm an asshole for \"wanting to pay to kill his child but not supporting them to make it live a good life instead\".\n\nI was overwhelmed by the situation and left immediatly after.\n\nMy sister texted me the following days relentlessly about how I don't love her if I don't support her decision and how I'm forcing her into the abortion.\n\nThey also told the rest of the family which are also firm to believe I'm a massive asshole in the situation, because I don't need \"all that money to live and I could easily support them\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your support, I will try to read every comment!", "I work in an office where I\u2019m one of the youngest and lowest level employees along with two others. \nBeing one of the low level staff I get asked to do a lot of admin/odd jobs that aren\u2019t anything to do with my job role. \n\nThis has never really bothered me while I was the only one at my my level & being the youngest (22) and hypothetically the fittest, however, a few months ago my work hired two girls my age at my level.\n\nI initially thought great someone to share the load of \u201ccrap jobs\u201d with so I can focus more on my actual work.

Becca had a great time! We all did. \n\nIt was a three night affair, and a male stripper came the last night we were there. Becca\u2019s good friend, Anna, got really into the stripper. I don\u2019t know Anna very well- we\u2019ve only met a few times, but she\u2019s nice and we get along great. Anna is engaged and getting married sometime this winter (haha I don\u2019t know the date honestly). We\u2019re bridesmaids together. \n\nAnna was even more about the stripper than the bride. When the stripper got naked, so did she. She was basically shoving her boobs at the guy. She licked whipped cream all over him. Etc. Which, you do you boo! She did mention to me her fianc\u00e9 probably wouldn\u2019t be ok with it. I chuckled awkwardly. Please note that everyone was well aware of the stripper coming and in agreement - it\u2019s not something that was sprung upon anyone!

At one point during the reception, I was (drunkenly) talking to Anna, another friend, and Anna\u2019s fianc\u00e9.

Her life growing up was not easy and I will always respect her for rising above all of that and persevering through it all.\n\nNow onto my problem. My wife has an issue with *any* substance that can get you high or drunk and understandably so. She made this clear after about 2 years of us dating when she told me about her family. Now this I have no issue with, I asked her if me having a few beers socially would be an issue and she said no.\n\nCut to the last few years and her anger to booze has become *much* more apparent. She claims my drinking 2 beers after working a stressful day makes me an alcoholic. Now if I was drinking every day she may have a point but I have maybe 3 beers a week at most and *maybe* once a month I may go to my buddy's place and play overwatch and have a few more. I don't get drunk by any stretch at my friend's place but just a good buzz and uber home. I have only ever been legitimately drunk 3 times in our relationship, NONE of which she was around for and only ever heard second hand. I like to think I'm respectful about it; I keep my beer in the minifridge in the basement, I don't drink in front of her and at her request I don't talk to her at all when I have those few beers on a friday.\n\nI have in the past quit drinking because she asked me to. Last time I quit for 2 years just because. Quitting is never an issue for me but her badgering me and claiming I'm an alcoholic *all the time* finally caused me to snap at her and tell her that just because her mother was an alcoholic doesn't mean I am. I told her that her extreme hatred for it is causing more issues for me than anything else in my life at this moment. She will literally go from the most sweet person to a completely passive aggresive person in one second when she realizes I bought a 6 pack for the next 2 weeks. The obvious answer is to just quit which would be fine but sometimes I just like to unwind after work you know? I don't get trashed on a regular and I don't let alcohol get in the way of my life so I'm at a loss. If she said \"it's me or the booze\" then I would 100% pick her but my issue is that her problem with alcohol isn't rational and it's not *me* she has an issue with but instead her issues with her mother.\n\nWe go out enough and we both hang around with people who drink and she has no issue with them so here I am wondering if I'm an asshole. I feel after a few years of her yelling at me I was justified in getting a bit upset but her friends are calling me an asshole.", "So about a month ago I met a girl in a coffee shop. We talked for a bit, exchanged numbers, and have gotten coffee a couple of times since then and have texted and what not.\n\nMy company was offering tickets to Game 6 of the Caps/Hurricanes series in NHL hockey for extremely good value. I have recently gone through a breakup of my girlfriend of five years and I'm really starting to like this girl so I decided to invite her to the game on a date. I tried to make this pretty apparent - it was meant to be a date. She agreed and said hockey is actually one of her favorite sports. At his point I'm super excited.\n\nWell I get to her place to pick her up for the game, and she comes out with a male \"friend\". She hops in the backseat with him and I am completely blown away. Not sure how to question her, I simply say \"I thought we were the only ones going, I only have two tickets.\"\n\nHer: \"Oh I didn't even think about it. This is my friend \\*whatever\\*, he wants to go too so I thought I would invite him.\"\n\nMe: \"That was nice of you, but I still only have two tickets. I can only take two people.\"\n\nHer: \"You can't find another ticket? I may have to stay home if that's the case.\"\n\nAt this point I was confused and frankly outraged. She had to have known the tickets were rare and not cheap - even if I got them at a great value. I kind of lost my cool and told them both to get the fuck out of my car - just with a few more words than that.\n\nI sped off and went to the game by myself. It was a fantastic experience, but unfortunately that encounter is literally all I could think about. I still can't believe it happened.\n\nThis morning I texted her to lose my number and blocked her. If her intent was to just bring a friend, maybe I was too harsh. That being said, I really wonder if they were actually just friends. Maybe she thought we were just friends and it wasn't actually supposed to be a date? Just sucks because I really thought she was interested in me - I sure was in her. Too good to be true I guess.\n\n\nINFO: Since some of you asked for additional info regarding how I asked her and what I said specifically.\n\nI started by asking her if she was busy on Monday (the night of the game). She said she had nothing planned. I then asked if she was interested in going to the game. My exact words were: \u201cI can get us tickets at work if you are interested.\u201d\n\nShe replied with \u201comg yes!\u201d And thats when she told me she loved hockey. I also suggested dinner but then realized we wouldn\u2019t have time before the game so she said we could just get food at the game. Sounds like a date to me.\n\nAs far as what I said in the car, once she said she would rather stay home than not go with her \u201cfriend\u201d, I said \u201cAlright then. That\u2019s kind of shitty of you. Guess you\u2019re not going, get the fuck out of my car.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and they both got out and I went on my way. Nothing really more than that.\n\nJust a massive kick to the nuts when I spent money on expensive tickets and was very excited to go with this girl just to have her basically make me go alone. It came out of nowhere and at no point in our prior get togethers did she hint that she wasn\u2019t interested in me. I mean we had the whole night planned out pretty clearly.\n\nEDIT: For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m thinking maybe she just lost interest in me and thought this would be an easy cop out. Tip to anyone: If you aren\u2019t interested in someone, tell them. Had she texted me days before the game and said \u201cIm not going to be able to go, Im just not interested. Have fun.\u201d I would\u2019ve said \u201cWell that sucks, but I\u2019m glad she was honest.\u201d I would\u2019ve found a friend to go with.\n\nBut to cop out like she did was brutal and just downright shitty.", "AITA So my mom has always been some what (okay a lot) of an authoritarian style parent.  There were a lot of time growing up where I didn't agree with her about something but was not allowed to voice that. And honestly even now, there are some of those times.\n\nI love my mom, she's the strongest person I ever met.  But because of this I have never shared much of my personal life with her.  I try to open up more now, because I want an open relationship with her.  And, to her credit she has tried a lot harder to be less strict but she's still her own way.\n\nWell because of this I have made it a point to involve my son in our lives as much as makes since given his age etc.  he has always been given a voice.\n\nOkay so let's get the background over... I'm a single mother to a 5 year old boy with several allergies. Some severe and some mild.  Including an array of food allergies. My mother babysits him while I am at work.  This generally means she is feeding him about one meal a week by my request, and sometimes he gets junk or treats there too.\n\nWell recently my mom was feeding him and the other kids (cousins) some dinner which happened to be cooked with an ingredient my son is allergic to.  It's complicated to explain the nature of that particular allergy but while he will likely not die from it, he is still usually caused a bit of discomfort when he eats it.  Hives, itchy mouth, etc.  Typically if it is cooked and he gets some, it's okay. But he has reacted to cooked too. So even though his epipen isn't for that specific food, we avoid it.  Basically he *can* eat it and not die but really shouldn't and he and I have decided together he won't. \n\nWell mom told him he had to eat his dinner or he was going to be in big trouble.  When he said no again she told him he was grounded from\nScreens all night until he cleaned his plate.  My son's reply was \"Fine. I don't care how much trouble I'm in I am NOT eating that.  You can't make me.\"\n\nWell of course my mom was livid when I got there to get him.  And she had told me he has to apologize before he can come back.\n\nI told her that I can't make him do that. I have taught him from day 1 that he can refuse to eat any food he's allergic to. No adult can make him poison himself. And I will 100% back that up.  \n\nNow mom is saying we are both AH's and need to apologize to her.  That she knows which foods he is deathly allergic to and which ones are \"fine as long as he has antihistamines if he gets hives.\" \n\nSo, AITA? And was my son holey-jr? \n", "My husband and I just got into (another) fight because his best friend who comes over every Wednesday is (again) staying the night. \n\nMy husband and this friend have had a Wednesday night \u201cdate\u201d where the guy comes over to our house to \u201cjam\u201d every week for the last two years, and I\u2019m getting to the point that I want to hit the guy over the head with whatever is closest at hand every time he is around. \n\nBuckle up. This is probably going to be a long one.... if you make it through all of this you are my hero. \n\nAt first he was supposed to come over just for a few hours on Wednesday nights to play guitar with my husband while I was at work. Over time I have stopped working late Wednesday\u2019s but the jam session continues. Which was fine. However, for the last year they have barely touched the guitars and instead the guy just comes over to get high (on pot). Neither my husband or I get high with him (I don\u2019t enjoy pot and my husband isn\u2019t much into it either, but we aren\u2019t morally against it so we didn\u2019t say anything early on when we should have). \n\nNow that he is always high here, he NEVER leaves at the end of the night. Just expects to sleep over. But he doesn\u2019t have a regular sleep schedule so instead of sleeping while we are, he is wandering around our house all night (in his boxers) making noises, watching tv, getting nonstop text alerts from other friends and ect. This always wakes me up and I have to pass by him on the way to the bathroom. At these points he always has demands. Like: \u201cI want to watch this random movie your husband said you had. Find it for me.\u201d Or \u201cyou need to change your litter box right now, because your cat just pooped and I can\u2019t stand the smell.\u201d He always says he\u2019ll leave when my husband goes for work at 8am, but then complains that he couldn\u2019t sleep until 6am, so he ends up sleeping until mid day. At which point he just decides to stay until my husband gets home from work and then the whole thing starts over again. What\u2019s supposed to be one night a week often turns into at least two every week. \n\nOn top of never leaving, he has started showing up HOURS before my husband gets off work on Wednesday\u2019s. My husband has told him \u201cmy home is your home\u201d so he just comes right in. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if he could self entertain. But no. He comes in and will just walk into our bedroom (where I\u2019m hiding) sit down on the bed, take a hit of his shit, and start talking to me through whatever I\u2019m doing/watching on tv. \n\nEvery time he is here he eats A LOT of our food (gets the munchies, plus regular meals) but never once has had the courtesy to bring anything of his own, or to share, or to replace what he is eating here. He just goes into our fridge and pantry and eats whatever he wants because my husband told him our home was his. \n\nMy husband is always begging me to be nice and not say anything while he is here because he is lonely and needs friends.... except he has his other best friend living with him, and is constantly going on weekend trips all over the country to visit his other friends.  Not to mention those nonstop text message alerts all night. \n\nDealing with this guy is like hanging out with a 17 year old stoner non stop. He farts and burps as loud as possible wherever. Whenever. Is demanding and needy, but completely rude at the same time. Saying things like \u201cdude! You actually made your house look SORTA nice this week.\u201d (As I was prepping for Christmas), and \u201cso you do sometimes make an effort on your looks\u201d (when I had gone somewhere nice and come home with makeup on). He also complains non stop about the food I make (yet eats it all anyway). \n\nThis year for my birthday we couldn\u2019t afford to get any gifts, so I asked my husband instead to line up his days off so we could spend four days just us together...... then this guy broke up with his girlfriend and my husband begged me to let him come over just for a bit on the first evening. Que TWO full weeks of him not going home, and demanding all of my husband\u2019s time. I spent \u201cour time\u201d and my birthday, holed up in our room alone. \n\nThen, Christmas comes. I had invited my whole family to our house and tried to make things extra special because it was the first time I got to see my parents on Christmas in more than ten years. This guy\u2019s mom had just moved to another state BUT this guy has plenty of money and no job to work around so he could have easily made the trip to her for Christmas. But he didn\u2019t. Then his other friend/housemate also went out of town and he threw a \u201cwoe is me, I\u2019m all alone one Christmas Eve, no one loves me\u201d tantrum until my husband invited him to our house. He shows up. Gets high. And is a complete ass to everyone. Then throws a fit when he decides to sleep over because he has to sleep on the couch in a sleeping bag (my family were in the other beds.) the next morning we sit down to breakfast and he lets out this HUGE stinky fart right at the table like it\u2019s nothing, then proceeds to dish himself up 90% of the food and just generally be a douche. My family was flat out disgusted by him and his behavior and couldn\u2019t wait to leave. He stayed for three days. \n\nI feel like an ass hole because he is my husband\u2019s best friend and I don\u2019t want to make them not hang out, and honestly he hasn\u2019t done anything truly terrible. He\u2019s just annoying as shit. I fucking dread every Wednesday, and then I\u2019m super irritated the whole time he\u2019s here. Which I hide from him, at my husband\u2019s request, but then my husband and I always end up fighting over him not leaving at the end of the night. \n\nI\u2019m honestly one or two Wednesday\u2019s away from homicide with this guy, and all this I\u2019ve told you is just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, please tell me AITA for being upset at my husband for letting this guy stay over again tonight, and wanting a substantial break from his best friend? \n\n\n\nTL;DR My husband\u2019s best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. AITA for not wanting him to come over for a LONG time? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you all for your overwhelming response!! I haven\u2019t been able to reply to all of you, but I want you to know I\u2019ve read every post and I appreciate all of your opinions (even the ones calling me a shrew) and your great advice! \n\nSome clarification and an update: In case you weren't already sick of reading all this >< \n\n\nClarification 1: As some have pointed out, there isn\u2019t much of an action here for me to ask AITA about. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make it clearer originally. The question is am I unreasonable and being an Ass Hole for wanting a break from having this friend over. My husband and I fought over this last night and he feels I\u2019m being overly upset and needlessly irritable at said friend. You\u2019ve already read how I feel about it. \n\n\nClarification 2: This post, admittedly doesn't give much positive about the friend. His friend has been in my husband\u2019s life since he was in grade school, and while the friend is over they do actively chat, watch movies, and generally hang out while I actively hide and feel irritated. All this stuff for sure could look like an exaggeration if it all happened in the last few days, but this is sorta my laundry list of the last two years of grievances which have been building up over time. On a regular Wednesday he is just stoned, flatulent, and childish, which while annoying, isn\u2019t really actively douchy. He has done some very nice things for my husband, such as paying to take him to some very expensive concerts so that they could both nerd out over their favorite guitar players Live. I -clearly- don\u2019t like the guy, but my husband gets a lot of enjoyment out of their friendship and I\u2019m not saying that has to stop. Just that -I- need a break. Also, my husband DOES have other friends, they just have lives so he only gets to hang out once every few months with them. He is also in a band with other friends whom he sees regularly every Monday night. \n\nClarification 3: My husband doesn\u2019t see a problem with how he speaks to me because according to him \u201cthe guy just has poor social skills, that comment about your makeup was a compliment.\u201d\n\nClarification 4: He smokes a vape style pot pen, not a physical bud, which has less residual scent and is why my husband told him he could do it in the house. Before he started using I was ok with him. He still had poor manners, but he wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as he is now, and he never spent the night (or longer). Back before the pot I even enjoyed hanging out with the two of them every so often. Oh and I KNOW my husband occasionally also imbibes with him, which isn\u2019t something that makes me mad. He doesn\u2019t go overboard like his friend. \n\nUPDATE: When I woke up this morning I noticed that my phone was buzzing\u2026. And buzzing\u2026. And buzzing\u2026. As all these awesome comments kept pouring in. I have never really had much success on Reddit, so when I looked and saw how many comments there were I said \u201cOh My GoD!\u201d Of course my husband asked what was wrong and I said \u201cI told the internet the story of ***** and asked if I was the ass hole for what we fought over last night.\u201d He said..\u201dOh\u201d and that was it. BUT then on his way out of the bedroom he said \u201cI\u2019m going to get him up\u201d, and by the time I was dressed and out of the room they guy was out of the house and driving away. Hallelujah!!! \n\nForty minutes later when he got to work I received a text message telling me how I was his best friend and that he loves me more than the world ect. Then we texted back and forth and he said \u201cI really feel like we both contribute to it. I feel like you are overly grumpy on things pertaining to *****. But at the same time, I invite him to come up extra days, or stay the night without running it by you. I feel we could both do better and relieve a lot of stress and frustration. Do you agree?\u201d  \n\nHe then called a few minutes later and I told him that I know I\u2019m grumpy but I feel like it\u2019s reasonably so. I also told him I didn\u2019t want to force them not to be friends just that -I- needed a break from the friend. Then I gave him some possible solutions such as hanging out at his house every other week, or have a set time that the guy needs to stop smoking in order to drive home later (thanks guys! Great suggestions!) and he agreed to consider other arrangements with the hang out time so that I could have some time away from the friend, and we agreed to talk more about it when he is off work tonight. Although I can tell he STILL isn\u2019t seeing a problem other than my attitude : / \n\nAgain thank you to everyone who has commented! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR My husband\u2019s best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. AITA for not wanting him to come over for a LONG time? \n", "I will admit, I was never the best father to my oldest son, Josh. When he was little, I was an alcoholic and fought with his mother constantly. Never anything physical, but he grew up with a lot of yelling and arguing and unfortunately finding me passed out in a drunken stupor many times. When he was about 5, I had an affair with another woman which eventually lead to a child being born. I ended up leaving my wife and starting a family with her and the child I had with her, Ben. It was then when I found god and got sober. Got a good job opportunity and moved a few states over. I tried to see Josh as much as I could, usually a few times a year and some holiday\u2019s. My ex-wife was nothing but supportive about him visiting me, I just wish I could have done it more. My ex remarried a few years later to a nice man, and I know he and Josh got very close over the years.\n\nFor Christmas when Josh was 15, he came to visit me, my wife and his brother. It was then he had came out to me as gay \u2013 and I did not react the way I should have. At that point in my life, I had found Christianity and it was tethered to keeping me sober \u2013 and unfortunately I bought into a lot of the anti-gay sentiments my local church used to preach. I don\u2019t visit that church anymore. For about two years we cut contact but I came to realization that I was wrong and I begged my son for forgiveness. He forgave me and we tried to regain the father/son relationship, although the distance being a few hours away didn\u2019t help. We still would only see each other a couple times a year.\n\nMy son is now 21 and for this last Father\u2019s Day, he surprised his step dad with a legal name change, changing his last name to match his step father\u2019s. When I heard this, my feelings were crushed. He had not even contacted me for Father's Day. I knew that he and his step dad were close but I didn't think he would ever change his name. The next time I saw him, I asked him about it \u2013 why he didn\u2019t at least give me a heads up. He told me that while he does forgive me for my past actions; he does not see me as a father figure and that his step father was always there for him. When I mentioned that he now didn\u2019t have the same last name as his brother, he said he didn\u2019t really care about that as he and his brother admittedly are not close.\n\nI was crushed and angry. I contacted my ex and told he how upset I was with this and how I would have appreciated a heads up from her. She said she had nothing to do with his decision and that he came to her having already decided to change his name. I feel really bitter and resentful; I don\u2019t even know where my relationship with my son will go from here now. I know I wasn\u2019t the best father but I don\u2019t know if I really deserve this? I feel like I should have had a heads up he was changing his name, instead of hearing about it after the fact. AITA here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: Reading the replies has really opened my eyes. My anger and resentment is misplaced and is coming from a place of complete guilt. I'm not angry or resentful of my son, I'm angry at myself for my past actions but my ego is making it feel otherwise. I'm currently writing a letter to my son's step father thanking him for being there for my son. I'm also going to apologize to my ex for blaming her for this because that was not right. I never brought any of this up to my son - after he gave me his explanation I stayed quiet. I know I've been a terrible father for most of his life - I hope even if he doesn't see me as a father figure, we can have a good relationship as an adult. He is a very thoughtful and forgiving person and I'm lucky he has given me multiple chances after many many screw-ups to still be apart of his life. I'm not going to mess it up again. Thank you, Reddit.", "Daughter and SD are 14&15 respectively. Wife and I have been married for 10 years. \n\nSo my late wife( she died fighting cancer )and I invested our money and decided to set up something like a trust fund for our daughter. Most of what my late wife inherited from her parents also went to this fund. All of this money is supposed to go to my daughter provided she meets some requirements. \n\nOn the other hand, my wife and her ex husband have nothing saved up for my stepdaughter. She asked me if I would add my SD as a recipient because the sum is quite large. I told her that my late wife contributed a lot to the fund and she wanted it to go to my daughter. She's upset because I'm being biased now. I think this is something which was planned a long time ago, even before I met my current wife. Also, it was something my late wife put a lot of effort into. WIBTA here?\n\nEdit: Edited ages. My daughter was 6mo old when her mother passed away.\n\nEdit2: We all agreed that my wife and her ex would pay for SD's college.

He is not deadbeat.", "Some background, my little sister is in the Army. I haven\u2019t seen her since August for a funeral. She hasn\u2019t really been able to take leave because she was flagged for her weight. Finally, she tells me in early December that she got approved to go on leave at the end of January, so I immediately went and put in for my vacation time at work. I haven\u2019t stopped talking about it and made everyone aware that I was taking this time to see my sister.\n\nMy job has a super strict first come, first served policy about taking vacations. My department only has 8 people and it\u2019s considered a trade so you can\u2019t just pull anyone off the street to cover for one of us, so only one person is allowed to take vacation at a time.\n\nThis past week, one of my coworkers asks off for the *exact same* week as me, saying he already spent $2,000 to go out of the country and our bosses \u201cbetter approve the time off because of how expensive it was.\u201d Our boss sees the request and pulls him aside telling him that he can\u2019t have it because I asked for it. Coworker cries to the big boss and big boss gives it to him, telling my boss to tell me to take my vacation \u201csome other time.\u201d I went to the big boss explaining the situation, he didn\u2019t do anything, so I went over his head. The DM was appalled and basically took away my coworker\u2019s vacation, wrote my store manager for breaking policy and told my coworker if he calls in more than once that week to go on said vacation, he\u2019ll get fired. \n\nI didn\u2019t mean to get everyone in trouble, but I asked for it over a month ago and I want to see my sister. Am I the asshole here? ", "I work at a small tech company where it's basically split between designers and project managers. I'm the admin assistant, so I do a little bit of everything until we find out what I'm good at. The others in the company come from much different experiences and life backgrounds than me. On the PM side, it's mostly women, and they love to talk about all the things they buy, travel, etc. \n\nOne of them pulled me into a conversation about travel and said we should all bring in passports to compare places we've been. I said \"Oh, I've never had a passport.\" She was shocked, asked me why not. I just said \"Oh, I can't really afford to travel.\" She looked confused and asked about when I was growing up, where would we go on family vacations. I said we didn't and changed the subject. She kept looking at me weird after that.\n\nThen came the purse thing. I've carried the same bag with me for about 6 years. One of the girls laughed at a fraying strap and said it was time for a new one, and suggested this brand I'd never heard of that kind of matched the style. I looked it up and said \"That's a really nice one! But wow, $150 for a purse!\" She looked at me funny and said \"Do you think that's a lot...?\" I said yes, that's basically two weeks groceries for me. She was very taken aback.\n\nThe \"inciting\" incident happened last week. One of the women recently started the process of buying a house. She's really excited and got her a nice candle. One of the women said that I was next, and I just said \"Haha, yeah right!\" One of the women asked when I thought I'd start looking, and I was honest and said that I don't really see home ownership as a part of my life. They were all shocked and kept trying to tell me why I was wrong, and I admit I got a little annoyed when they wouldn't drop it. I said \"With what money?\"\n\nIt got awkward after that, and the next day one of the women pulled me aside and told me that they're sick of the way I always have to be a downer about money, and that I always make it awkward when I talk about what I can't afford. I said \"Well, how do you think it makes me feel to have you guys constantly flaunting all the purses and high end makeup and designer clothes you're wearing.\" She said that they were bonding, that's what women do, and that from now on, I should try to be more discrete about the income disparity between us. \n\nI said \"Sure, if you guys will be, so will I.\" She gave me a look and said that I'm acting kind of like an asshole and punishing them for something that's not their fault. I told her that she was certainly entitled to that opinion, but that I think it's tacky to brag about all of the lavish things you can buy. She got pretty upset at that and now just one of the PM girls talks to me. AITA?", "My kids are aged 14 m and 15 f. The other day my son asked if I could wash his favorite shirt for some event coming up, so I told him I would and to put it in the hamper. Later that day I found it just sitting on the floor so I didn't bother. Same thing with my daughter, she asked me to wash something (don't remember what) and she got the same response. Same thing happened with the piece of clothing on the floor instead of the hamper so I didn't bother\n\nLater in the evening they started bitching about the clothes they requested not being washed and I told them \"all you had to do was put it in the hamper\" to which my son said \"yeah but it was near the hamper you can just pick it up\" to which my daughter agreed. I didn't say anything more about the issue\n\nThe next morning I went to the dollar store and bought some laundry detergent. When my kids came down for breakfast it was sitting on the table, and they asked what it was. I informed them that until they stop being entitled spoiled brats that they can wash their own clothes, but not with MY washing machine. I informed them they will be washing all THEIR clothes from now on in the bath tub with dollar store detergent until they start being respectful and I receive an apology for the remarks about picking up their crap near the hamper AND once the detergent runs out they have to use their own money to buy more but they're only allowed to buy it at the dollar store. Then came more whining and bitching \n\nIt's been a week and they still haven't apologized and I'm saving time, money and water on only washing mine and my husband's clothes. My husband said I'm being \"harsh\" but I don't think so. So am I the asshole for teaching my kids a lesson?", "My ex-wife and I divorced almost two years ago and don't co-parent great-mostly just try to ignore one another unless necessary for us to interact (not mature, I know, but my attempts to change that were not met kindly). We have three children together and the youngest, Evan (8), has been struggling the most with the divorce. The past few months he\u2019s been having meltdowns when he doesn't get his way- if we go to a restaurant he likes but that one of his brothers picked, or if he is made to clean his room instead of playing video games. He will yell that we're all mean, he doesn't like us and call his mom to come get him. She does, and then an hour or so later he gets dropped back off. I've asked her to not come get him, that it\u2019s my parenting time and he has to learn that he can't run away whenever he doesn't get his way, but she basically told me to f- off.\n\nSo I picked the kids up Friday and told Evan that if he called his mom to come get him that he had to stay with her all weekend and I would see him again the next day I had custody (I have him two days a week and three weekends a month). He got mad Saturday morning over multiple things and called his mom to come get him. When she showed up, I reiterated the new rule to him and told her that if she took him she was keeping him all weekend. She basically blew me off and they left. A couple hours later when I was out with the other two, she called to see where I was because Evan had cooled down and was ready to come back and she had \"things to do.\" I reminded her that I told both of them if he left that he was with her all weekend. She blew up my phone all day angry because she had plans and couldn't find a sitter, Evan called upset a couple times but I held my ground. He called Sunday and was apologetic and asked if he could come to church with us and I told him yes and kept him the rest of the day and he was much better behaved. My ex says I am an asshole, which I\u2019m used to, but then when I told my mom and sister, they also said I was too harsh and should've let him come back Saturday and I find a different way to handle the behavior issues. I was feeling pretty proud of myself until I talked to them. Should I drop this new rule or just ignore their opinion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Wow, thanks for all the responses. I got a lot of really good advise and things to think about. I have made an appointment with my attorney to discuss getting Evan into therapy that she can not interfere with and also to find out my best course of action for when/if she shows up in the future. Wanted to jump on and answer a couple questions, though. A lot of people asked how Evan was contacting his mom- she got him a phone for Christmas. He is not supposed to bring it to my house bc I once took it away when he and his brothers were bickering all day (they all go their phones taken away). Evan told his mom and she told me I had no right to take his phone away since she paid for it. So I told her that the phone stays at her house when he is with me but half the time he hides it and I don't know he has it. He will also call/text her by getting one of his brother's phones. Once he even went in my office and Facetimed her on my iPad. I usually don't know he's doing this because the things he decides he is going to call her about are random and often benign. Once, he called her because he didn't want to go to Lowes. He whined about going, I told him he couldn't stay home by  himself so he had to go and proceeded to finish cleaning up the kitchen. Less than 10 minutes later and his mom is at the door to get him. He hadn't thrown a tantrum or anything-just normal whining that my other boys did at that age. Later that afternoon when all the boring errands were done and I was about to take the older boys to a movie he got dropped back off. Mostly when he calls her he is not emotional and crying- he just isn't getting his way and is frustrated. The older two got the same way at his age (heck they get frustrated now if they are told no) but they didn't have the option at his age to have someone come get them so they go their way.", "About 22 years ago my dad had an affair and got his mistress pregnant. He confessed all to my mom who responded \"take care of your responsibility but I never want to hear about this again.\" So my dad did just that- he paid child support and had a relationship with my brother but spoke of it to no one except his attorney, his mother, and sister. He claims  a lapse in judgement and has been faithful and committed to my mom since.\n\n5 years ago I ran into my aunt and Nana having lunch with a teenage boy. They seemed uneasy but asked if I wanted to join them and I really hit it off with Nicholas. He was cool as shit and we had a lot in common even though I was 22 and he was 16. I asked my Nana  how they knew him and she brushed me off. Later that day my dad asked me to meet up and told me that Nicky was my half brother and the whole story. All these years that we thought my dad was working, out of town on business or on a guy's trip he was usually with Nicky. At first I was really angry but then I felt really bad for him and Nicky and told him I wanted to have relationship with my brother. He said ok and seemed happy about it but asked that I not tell my siblings or let my mom know because it would devastate her. I played along for a few years. I was at Nicky's graduation, took him on his senior trip  backpacking in Europe, and helped him move into his college dorm. We're as close as if we grew up together.\n\nI recently got engaged and in planning the wedding decided I wanted Nicky as a groomsmen with my other brothers. I told my dad and he agreed it was time to end the charade and my mom would have to face it. So he told my mom and my mom called me and begged me not to let the family secret out and how that was a hard time for her and she can't face my father's son. I felt bad but I think that my brother is also innocent in this and that my mom needs to be an adult and face reality. So we told my siblings. There have been a lot of emotions over the past few months but my siblings  love Nicky and he's really happy to have brothers and sisters and fits right in. My dad seems relieved to have all his kids together and not to be keeping a secret. My mom spent the entire summer at our beach house and still seems to be in denial.\n\nHer sister (my aunt) says I'm an asshole bc I should've stayed out of it. 2 of my 4 siblings think I'm an asshole for keeping the secret for so long. They think its unfair that I got to make so many memories with Nicky and they didn't get to. One of them is around Nicky's age and is really bummed she didn't know she had a brother so closer to her age. I think they have lots of time to make memories with him now and that I was in a tough place and made a hard decision but that doesn't make me an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a few edits to clarify some things:\n\n1. My dad hasn't been going behind my mom's back to see Nicky. When I spoke to my mom, she indicated that she knew that my dad had a relationship with him and my dad said that he told her during the \"I don't want to hear about it talk\" that he told her that he couldn't just throw money at the child but not be involved and my mom said she knew he couldn't. While he never said \"I'm going to Nicky's soccer game tonight and won't be home for dinner\" my mom told me sister during a talk a couple months ago that she almost always knew when my dad was with Nicky. \n2. My wedding isn't until next year (next October) and if my mom still hasn't dealt with the situation and feels that she can be part of the day, then we will push it back a little more if we need to. My SO fully supports me in this. I wanted the secret to come out now so that we weren't dealing with it right before the wedding and Nicky wasn't being introduced as our brother at the wedding. That's a total asshole move and never occured to me to do \n3. There have been a lot of comments about me not loving my mom and being callous towards her. This was not my intention. I love my mom. She is wonderful and loving and I don't want to cause her any pain but I also do think that my parents made the wrong decision 22 years ago to keep Nicky a secret and that she's had 22 years to come to terms with his existence. No one sees her as someone to pity. If anything, everyone's respect for my dad has gone down a few notches for being unfaithful, however, my mom had/has a chance to act with grace and compassion and I think that is what most people will see: my dad is the louse and my mom is the saint for staying with him, forgiving him, and being tolerant of Nicky. \n4. I know I talked a lot about my dad being happy and some negative comments made about that. My dad is not overjoyed that my mom is hurting but he is relieved to not be living two lives anymore. Despite his infidelity, he is an upstanding guy and it bothered him to continue lying to his children and he hated sneaking around. \n5. Yes, my sister was 3 months old when my dad confessed the affair. The affair lasted about 6 months and began around a time when my parents were living apart and continued for a couple months after they reunited (they reunited right before my sister was born). Their separation had nothing to do with infidelity or lying.\n6. My mother has not been alone at the beach house. My dad has been with her a lot of the time and each of us siblings has visited her. She's also had friends staying with her. \n\nAlso, just because I don't want people to think that my parents have a bad marriage that my mom has suffered through all these years for us kids-they don't. They are loving and affectionate. My dad adores my mother and she adores him. She has told us that she stayed with my dad then because she loves him and that the affair was out of character for him and she didn't believe he would do it again. She does not want a divorce and everyone really is trying to help her through it as much as possible.", "For context, I'm adopted and have super long & very thick red hair. No one in my adopted family has hair like mine,and it's been kind of a thing for them to touch, admire, & talk about my hair at family gatherings since I was a kid. My aunt has lung cancer, and it's really taken a toll on her. She's lost all her hair and has talked about getting a wig, but they're too expensive and she says she wants real hair. My mom suggested I donate my hair to make a wig for my aunt at Easter dinner, and my aunt got so excited she started crying. I felt horrible about it, and didn't say anything. We went to this wig place and the lady said she could make a shoulder length wig for my aunt using my hair. (I keep it up extremely well & it's down to my knees) My aunt started crying again and again I feel so awful, but I really don't want to part with my hair. I know it grows back but still.\n\nNo one had asked me how I felt, but I think my mom could tell I wasn't very excited about it because she asked the lady if she could donate her own hair, and she said she'd need both my sister (mom's biological daughter) and my mom to donate their hair, since it's very thin, and she could only make a chin length wig with it. My aunt also wants red hair, so the lady said she'd have to dye it & that would cause it damage & cost more than using my hair. My uncle then said it'd make much more sense to use mine.\n\nIt's been a month and my aunt wants to know when we can make the appointment. I don't know what to do. I told my sister and she called me ungrateful and told me to stop being selfish because it would grow back. If I'm TA I won't hesitate to donate it but I don't know anymore.\n\nEDIT: People suggested I clarify, I have knee length hair & I'd have to cut all of it off to the scalp in order to make the wig.\n\nTo all the people saying it doesn't take that much hair to make a wig: it does. One average donation of hair doesn't make a full wig, they match it with other donations. It usually takes 2-3 heads of hair for a full wig. Mine is long enough on its' own for a full wig, and my aunt doesn't want synthetic hair mixed in to supplement it.\nI completely understand everyone that said I was the asshole for not saying no in the beginning. I'm not trying to justify that, but I want to make it clear that it's extremely difficult for me to stand up to my family. I don't think I've ever had a say in anything since I started living with them, and that's how it's always been. They never give me a voice, even though I should have spoken up. It always goes without saying that what my mom says will happen.", "Before I start, I would respectfully ask you to consider the fact that I am still mourning and not speak ill about my sister.\n\nMy sister died 2 weeks ago of overdose. She had 2 children (2 and 5), fathers unknown.\n\nBecause I am the closest family (one of our parents in jail, the other dead) I was expected to take guardianship. I dont want them to have any more trauma than they do already but I had never wanted kids. I am not good with nor like kids. \n\nMy cousin, who has kids of his own, proposed to take the guardianship instead (his wife is in board). I support that. That would give them both a father figure, other kids to play with, loving family.\n\nBut I feel like a horrible person. I would not feel so bad if it was a strictly practical solution. But I genuinely dont want them. For a moment I was horrified I would be forced to take them.

Then about 5 mins later the dude bangs on our door and yells at us that he doesn\u2019t wanna hear us fucking and threatens to call the cops or apartment management if he ever hears us again.  \n  \nSo, am I the asshole here for getting down, or is he the asshole for losing his shit and demanding us change our lives for him?  \n  \n  \nEdit: Holy crap, I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up.

I support her 100%. \nWhen she told me she is trans I got behind it immediately. I referred to her with the correct pronouns privately and used her chosen name for a full year before she came out. I fought for her when members of our family rejected her and I would and have immediately cut anyone off if they are in any way hateful towards her. \n\nWhen she came out she was embraced by many but rejected were loudly by enough people for it to be absolutely devastating. As a result we became very close and spend much more time together than we did before. \n\nNow, for the shitty part. Ever since she came out she\u2019s been getting progressively more annoying. She FAKES stupidity, like will actually put on a 2000\u2019s style Paris Hilton ditzy act.

My nephew is 8 years old and is terribly, terribly obese. He has joint issues on his knees, has that classic overweight knock knees stance, he\u2019s cried miserable tears to me in private before because he has to wear enormous basketball shirts and nothing else which he hates, etc.\n\nI\u2019m always trying to get him into physical activity, I\u2019ve privately spoken to his parents because he feels left onto of his cousins games because they\u2019re all so much more mobile, etc. However they are feeders and I\u2019ve personally seen them buy and feed him things that should feed a family of 4 and he\u2019s able to demolish it in one go. \n\nWhen we go on these camps we usually go for 2 or 3 weeks at a time, and this time I made sure. I was way more active in the food prep so I could monitor what he ate. He\u2019s my favorite nephew and I felt he deserves way more than this. \n\nI swapped out his sodas for la croix, when it was breakfast time I loaded the kid up on bacon eggs and sausage but I held back the toast and maple syrup, and when it was smores time I made sure he had some s\u2019mores but I made them up myself with less chocolate and graham crackers and more strawberry and marshmallow. \n\nStuff like that. \n\nNow my nephew is so big that I didn\u2019t SEE a difference, but I kept asking him how he felt every day and the one thing I wanted more for him than anything else- he told me he felt awesome and he was actually for the first time in his life running around with his peers! He would sweat like a lil grubby booger and need to take time out but he could actually PLAY without being in tears from pain. \n\nAt the end of the trip I talked to him and told him that I had made some small swaps to his mealtimes and wasn\u2019t it awesome that he was able to get more energy from it?? He reacted in tears, hugged me so tight that I couldn\u2019t breathe and was honestly so excited to make a grocery list with me and get the stuff he needs for home. He asked if he had lost weight and I told him that I honestly didn\u2019t know because we hadn\u2019t weighed him (he obviously has lost weight but this isn\u2019t about weight, it\u2019s about health) but I told him he probably had built up a lot of strength. \n\nWhen we told his parents my brother was super chill about it but his mom flipped. The fuck. Out.

Even my more sensible siblings think I shouldn\u2019t have interfered.", "Just had a fight with my SO because of what I told our daughter about \"legit violence\". Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\n\nSo there's this kid in my daughters day care. He's the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \n\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won't stop it even after being told by the adults. \n\nSo basically I told my daughter that it's totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\n\nAITA?\n\n__________________\n**Edit:** Holy crap, this exploded. Thanks for the gold! I didn't expect to get so much feedback and thank everyone who participated in the still ongoing discussions.\n\nI'll add some details here. \n\n1. My daughter told me this whilst we played Legos. It was just some of those random kid stories that sometimes come out. This shows me it's something that she thinks about. I don't want her to develop a negative attitude towards her day care, so I considered this to be a small problem that could get bigger and therefore needed a solution.\n\n2. I don't the other kid is a bully. His parents have a hard time as they also have a severely autistic older son that needs a lot of their time. And when they have time for him, they are overly careful. I also don't think that his behavior is a sign of sexual abuse, but he might be emotionally troubled.\n\n3. I think that the daycare teachers do a good job but they don't have all-seeing-eyes. \n\n4. I wish my daughter becomes a straight forward, self-conscious and secure person that always finds ways to voice or show things that make her uncomfortable. I'd like her to know that she can talk to me and my SO about everything, especially in her teen years. \n\n", "Ok, backstory. My (27F) husband's (29M) older sister (36F) had a child when she was 19 from a one night stand. He was adopted by a nice couple a couple states over in an open adoption. They will send her pictures, are friends on Facebook and occasionally have little get togethers. He calls her \"Mama T\", as her name starts with a T. Although she does not celebrate mother's day with him, she asks those around her to wish her a happy mother's day and becomes depressed when she is not acknowledged. She is very active in birth mother groups and speaks annually at a camp on birth mother's trauma and issues. She is unmarried and has always desperately wanted to have a family and children.\n\nAlso for reasons that are not relevant (medical), my husband and I have decided adoption is the best idea as we cannot/will not have a biological child together naturally.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, T announced that she is pregnant again. She told us she wants to have the baby but, once again, is not in a financial position to keep the child. So she's looking for adoptive families. Our families all know that we have been looking to adopt and so she came to us about possibly adopting her child.\n\nMy husband thinks it would be a good idea. The timing is right and his sister is a \"known quantity\", as he put it. IE we know she isn't doing drugs or drinking. I'm not opposed, but I had some concerns. For one thing, I don't want my child calling anyone else \"mom\". We also live 45 minutes away, and from the way she acts from her first child's birthday and mother's day, I'm not sure it would be healthy for anyone involved.\n\nAfter discussions, last weekend we went to T and told her we would be willing to adopt her child. She and my MIL were thrilled, as the only other prospective birth parents she had spoken to were 2000 miles away. Until I told T that she would be Aunt T, not Mama T. She freaked on me. Told me that I was trying to erase her role as birth mother from the child's life. I told her that the child would be very aware they were adopted and that T was their birth mother, but they would not be referring to her or treating her as a mother. She burst into tears and said I was trying to take her baby from her. I told her that, if we adopted it, it wouldn't be her baby anymore. That... didn't go over well.\n\nMy MIL has decided to stay out of this issue as much as possible. The entire rest of the family, who lives nearer to them, has been telling me that I'm being heartless and selfish and taking out my misery of being unwilling (they all know I'm capable) to bear children on her. My husband supports me in front of them. He has said that if we aren't united then we won't do it, but has also privately expressed to me how nice it would be to have a child genetically related to him. I guess he didn't realize how strongly he felt about passing on his genes until the option was back on the table?\n\ntl;dr I refuse to adopt my SIL's unborn child unless I'm the only one called mom.

I'm 21 and she's 20.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took the news badly at first. I became surly, didn't talk, and just kept to myself for 2 whole days right after she told me. I was terrified and did NOT want to be a father at all. I just needed time to adjust to the news. I think she expected happiness from both of us as she imagined I'd scoop her up and kiss her and cry tears of happiness after hearing she's pregnant (I know this bc she even referenced that scene in The Office where pam/jim find out they're having a baby).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur relationship during this time was extremely rocky because she wanted us to be engaged before the baby came, and I dragged my feet. I took her to all of her appointments, paid for as much as I could afford, and was there 24/7 for anything she needed. I guess it was more emotional connection that I just couldn't force through and she could tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago she sits me down and tells me she lost the baby. She says she had stomach cramps and then she miscarried. I was asking her a lot of health questions (I didn't know if a miscarriage this late into a pregnancy was normal?) and she kinda waves me off and is like don't worry I'm ok. After this our relationship's getting slightly better only because I'm slightly more relaxed now. She could tell and asks me to be honest about how I feel about the miscarriage. I tell her I'm sad it's happened so suddenly and mostly still worried for her but deep down I am really relieved because I 100% wasn't ready to be a father.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWRONG answer. She starts screaming, crying, throwing things at me. She says she's not miscarried, that it was a test to see my dedication and I've failed it completely. In short we fought for like 3 whole days after this, with little sleep bc she'd randomly throw cups of icy water on me if I dozed off. At the end of that I said I can't do this anymore and broke up with her. I told her I'll be there for the baby and I'll pay my share of whatever is needed but I can't be her boyfriend and I can't marry her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\nNow friends and family are all telling ME that I overreacted, that its just pregnancy hormones and could I blame her? Everyone's saying things like \"you can't leave a 20 year old girl to be a single mother\" but I know that if I married her it could be the worst mistake of my life. AITA?", "My girlfriend and I have a daughter who is the absolute light of my life. My girlfriend has always been more of a hands on parent, but I am actively involved in our daughter's life and do things with her every day. However, my girlfriend often nags me about doing more for our daughter and yells at me for not anticipating what our daughter needs all the time. I pointed out to her that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different from a biological perspective; from the beginning, she needed to have more hands on time with our daughter because of post partum depression and breast feeding and such, and these types of things carry on through childhood as our daughter is naturally more used to physical contact and comfort from her mother than from me. My girlfriend did not like this at all and blew up at me and accused me of being sexist. I am not sexist; I just think there is a fundamental difference between a mother and her child and a father and his child, and some things that come naturally to her don't come naturally to me. Am I the asshole for my view?", "Let me just start off and say I think cheating is deplorable.\n\nI have two brothers, John (28) and Matt (25).\n\nAround three years ago, our family exploded when it came out that Matt was having an affair with John's fiance. A fiance who was 6 months pregnant. Matt turned out to be the father.\n\nJohn was understandably humiliated and angry. I was fully on his side.  I was disgusted with Matt and the fiance.\n\nHere's my issue though. At John's insistence, Matt has pretty much been excommunicated from our family. He isn't allowed at any gatherings where John is. And John purposely makes sure he is at every one. \n\nMatt married John's ex-fiance and are raising the 2.5 year old together.\n\nTo this day, Matt's wife is referred to as a whore and the baby is called a bastard. Only by John but in our family's presence. He hates them with a passion even today.\n\nMy parents have really struggled with this but have agreed to follow John's rule of no contact with the wife or baby. Even contact with Matt is done in secret.\n\nMatt has been kicked out of our family business because John can't be in the same room as him. All photos of Matt have been hidden in the family home. No gifts have been given to Matt's child at all.\n\nAm I absolutely crazy to think that three years of this is enough? \n\nMatt is clearly remorseful and has apologized many times in tears. He clearly regrets hurting our brother.\n\nI can understand that John is absolutely hurt and it must've been the most painful betrayal.\n\nBut I still love both my brothers. Matt did a shitty thing but how much more does he need to be punished?\n\nMy poor parents have been broken hearted for the past three years because of this. They have confided in me that they are willing to forgive Matt and move on and regret letting it get this far. We were such a tight knit family before.\n\nBut I'm really worried that suggesting forgiveness with John will cause a massive fight and he'll make us choose between them. I also worry about his mental health.\n\nThere also the innocent child in this. He deserves a relationship with his grandparents and his aunt.\n\nI have recently been visiting Matt and his family. They are clearly struggling with the isolation. His wife broke down and apologized as I held my nephew for the first time. My heart tore in two.\n\nAITA for wanting to bring them into our family again and forgiving them? There is family reunion coming up in a week and I want them to attend.", "Me and my friend, Mark, have our own podcast dedicated to movies and entertainment. The podcast was his idea and he's more or less the main host, but I'm the co-host and we both appear on every episode, sometimes just the two of us and sometimes with other friends. But about a month ago, Mark brought in his girlfriend, Meg, and she added absolutely nothing to that episode. We were discussing the Phase 4 of MCU films and during our conversation, Meg just randomly interrupts and asks \"Is Batman in the MCU?\" The whole episode was just her asking really dumb questions like that and Mark had to explain to me that she doesn't really follow movies as close as we do. I asked him why he even brought her on, and he said \"She wanted to be on, so I said yes.\" I even told him that our podcast would benefit from having guests who are more knowledgeable on movies and he said that he'll try to explain that to her.\n\nEver since then, she's been on every episode we've done and our podcast has been taking some heat for it. Comments have been left telling us that she's detrimental since she rarely knows what she's talking about and she always interjects with comments and questions that make no sense. For example, a few weeks ago we were talking about Hobbs and Shaw and Meg kept referring to Idris Elba as Chris Rock. We kept having to correct her and she said \"Didn't a movie with Chris Rock just come out?\" We had no clue what she was talking about and it was really frustrating. Whenever she's not making stupid comments, she's always interrupting with some non sequitur, like one time when she randomly asked if soup counts as a drink while we were discussing the new Zombieland 2 trailer.\n\nBut a couple of days ago is when things got ugly. Me, Mark, Meg, and a couple of other friends were on the show and we were suppose to be giving our thoughts on Ready or Not, but Meg seemed to be upping her interrupting, non sequitur game. I was trying to give my thoughts on the movie, but Meg was taking selfies and kept asking Mark what she thought of them. I was really trying to control myself, but she just kept interrupting me with questions like \"What's this movie even about?\" and \"Are we ever getting another Titanic movie?\" It reached a point where I was trying to talk and she interrupted by asking \"Have any of you guys ever been to Paris?\" I lost my temper and shouted \"SHUT THE FUCK UP!\" at her. And while we were still recording, Mark yells at me to not talk to her like that and I started yelling that I'm done with the show. \n\nI stormed out and called Mark later, telling him that I'm no longer going to be part of the podcast if he keeps bringing Meg on. I explained that she's affecting our views, but he said that she keeps asking to be on and he doesn't want to say no to her. I reiterated that I'm going to quit if he keeps letting Meg on and then he accuses me of ruining our podcast and that I'm \"going too far.\"", "Me and my wife have been married for almost two years. Its been our dream to have a big family. She is 21, i am 24. We are both healthy and have an active sex life, but she has a heart shaped uterus and has miscarried twice,  the last time being two months ago. After losing two of my children i am also depressed but I try to keep a positive attitude for her.\n\nOur second miscarriage was in the second trimester and was very difficult as we both started to feel like \"mommy and daddy\". We were \"competing\" over which gender it would be.\n\nI thought the baby would be a boy so i bought a bunch of baseball stuff for babies, little hats and mitts. I also made my ringtone on my phone \"watching scotty grow\" by bobby goldsboro. Just sort of a playful thing since i joked we would name him after my grandpa scott, she wanted a girl and made hers that \"girls want to have fun\" song.\n\nAnyway, the baby was a girl named Charlotte. Shes been despondent these past few months. I havent been exactly ecstatic either but she wont even eat some days.\n\nI kept my ringtone the same for a little bit, partly because i was sad and partly because i forgot. She heard it one day and started crying terribly. I changed it, but i also resolved then to try and make her feel at least somewhat better.\n\nWife doesnt like cats and dogs arent allowed where we live but she had a hamster growing up. I bought a baby hamster with a big glass case and put a teeny tiny pink bow on her. I gave her to my wife with a card that said \"Would you be my new mommy?\"\n\nShe reacted terribly to it and said that it made her feel horrible and that i was being an insensitive asshole. Im just trying to help and the way she reacted put me on the defense so we got into an argument and arent on speaking terms since last friday. I keep the hamster with me on the coffee table as i sleep on the living room couch. Ive seen her play with it but she wont talk to me.\n\nAITA?", "Using an alt for obvious reasons. \n\nIt\u2019s last Friday night. My wife and I run a small mom & pop restaurant in the US. We are always busy on Friday nights, when we are filled to capacity we have 300+ in our restaurant. \n\nWe welcome people and groups from all background and all walks of life. We do not discriminate against anyone and take care of every customer like they are family. \n\nWe are mainly and chicken and seafood grill. We serve other items, but our main selling point is our hot wings and shrimp. \n\nThere was a family that came in last week from out of town with a special needs child. He was being very loud the whole time and screaming. I politely asked the family if they could calm him, as we were filled to capacity and the screaming was disturbing half the guests in our restaurant. \n\nHe calmed down, then about 5 minutes later he started back again except this time he was cursing and screaming racial slurs at an African American family sitting behind them. This is where I drew the line. The mother was distraught about it and apologized refusely, but I couldn\u2019t let them stay. I asked them to leave, though I did give them 50% off their meal (I don\u2019t feel like I should have.)\n\nI let the African American family eat for free and gave them a voucher for a free order of hot wings, which they said they would use soon. \n\nMy thought process is, they were using slander and racist slurs against a large percentage of our clientele. I couldn\u2019t have that. \n\nAm I the asshole? My family tells me that I singled them out and embarrassed them in front of everyone, but if this was a national chain they were in doing this then they would have been kicked out immediately with no exceptions. ", "So for background, my gf comes from a more frugal family than I do. She has always deliberated more about prices and buying things than I do. She can spend months looking at different brands and buying guides before purchasing something, whereas I will see something I want, check the reviews and if I can afford it, and buy it. This hasn't really been a problem before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur finances are almost completely separate, but we do live together. This happened last week, when I mentioned in passing that I was excited for the computer to come in the mail. She all of a sudden blew up on me that I shouldn't spend that kind of money without asking her. I can more than afford this computer. AITA\n\nEdit: many people are talking about poor spending habits or asking how much I make, so I\u2019m putting it up here. I make 350k + investment returns and she now makes 150k. I make more than I spend. I do not have a habit(I think) of overspending, I only buy expensive things for stuff I use often, ie computers, stove, car. I don\u2019t buy $1000 smoothie machines.\n\nUpdate: I talked to her and I turns out she had a bad day at work and wasn\u2019t really mad. She does however want to be informed, not asked permission of, for purchases around that amount.

I get up to go to work everyday before my wife or child are awake during the week. On the weekends sometimes I will still wake up early and take care of the baby if I\u2019m already awake. If I\u2019m still asleep sometimes my wife will tell me to get up and take care of the baby so she doesn\u2019t have to do it. AITA for telling her no and that I want to get a little extra sleep on weekend mornings?\n\nEDIT: I help my wife with our baby every evening and on the weekends.

They are shared responsibilities and I try to help my wife by taking on responsibilities when I am home.", "Here we go - I have been in a group of friends (husbands, wives, kids) for almost 20 years.  We started out as a neighborhood group and have grown bigger as our friendships have evolved and most of us have moved out of the original subdivision.  We are adults 40-50 years old.  The men play golf most every weekend and one evening during the week.  Holidays and birthdays are big get-togethers with sometimes 50 people. I am currently the only unmarried person in the group (divorced in 2011).  This is the sticky part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 7-8 months ago, one of the women in the group named Cindy, started coming on to me.  While flattered, I would never do anything as I like her husband Mike and have know her kids since they were preschoolers.  It seemed like a little harmless flirting at first, but then it moved into some very direct propositioning.  She had her reasons for wanting to become sexually involved and put a mild bit of pressure on me to begin an affair with her.  One of the ways she pressured me was to text me racy pics and those soon moved to x-rated pics and videos.  It really put me in an awkward spot and I told her that.  My response was that I found her attractive, but she was strictly off limits to me since she was married.  Even if I didn't know her husband - I still would not have done anything.  And I didn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few months ago, I found out that I had missed a few golf days and I just chalked it up to bad timing.  Well....there was a huge 4th get together and I asked around about it and it seemed no one would own up to me not being invited.    Apparently, there have been other events that I didn't know about and I wasn't invited there either. I finally got some answers last night when I ran into a friend and her daughter at the grocery store.  She would barely look at me when I spoke to her and her teenage daughter spilled the beans.  Cindy was caught with the racy pics on her phone and \"confessed\" to Mike that I had put her up to it and was pressuring *her* to have an affair.  Needless to say, I was stunned at this revelation.  I thanked her for her honesty and went home and thought about it for a long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have saved every single text and pic.  Last night I printed them all out.  If I showed Mike 10% of what she said to me and what she sent to me - he might leave her.  Meanwhile - I am pushed out of my friend group for doing what I thought was right.  I told her at the beginning that this was heading down a road of hurt - but when she got to the painful part, she pushed me under the bus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:  I reached out to Mike and he texted me that he never wants to see or talk to me ever again.  Some of you have suggested that I reach out to a leader in the group and I have done that - I will be meeting with another couple tonight.  She is a gossip, so anything I show her or tell her will be public knowledge two hours after I leave their house.  You get what you get.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE #2: It turns out that the whole group knows nothing, just a few.  Mike and Cindy filed for divorce in January due to his infidelities and tried to keep it private.  From my end, everything is good.  It turns out that both or them are assholes.", "So we've been married for just shy of 3 years now and my husband is really getting on my case to have a baby. To give you readers a sense of \"getting on my case\" I mean like asking for a deadline on when to start trying and questinioning me on going back to school because that means that babies might be delayed.\n\nI've stated that I do want to have kids but not right this second. My main concern is that there is A LOT in instability and uncertainty in our lives right now. His job has taken us to live in Europe for 3 years and in a year we will be moving again, but we don't know where to yet. I want to wait until there's a little more certainty in life and to know that I'm going to have a good support system in place because he travels for work for long periods of time. His response to all of that is \"I don't want to wait anymore\" and \"people do this all the time\" and \"it's not fair to him\" \n\nNow I understand that there is no perfect time to have babies however I'm a firm believer that if your gut is telling you that it's not a good time, then it's not a good time\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE: honestly I'm surprised on how fast post took off. I am seeing a lot of the same INFO requests. So let me clarify.\nAge: me 33, him 30\nWe did have extensive discussions prior to and after our marriage. We both agreed that we wanted to have time together before we brought kids into the picture. He was planning on switching careers to create a more stable life to start a family. He has since changed his mind on that which means lots of moving and moving away from friends and family for the foreseeable future. As for my education, that was also discussed extensively but was put on hold because of financial constraints. Until lately.\nYES I want children and no I'm not stringing him along.  \nDid I miss anything? ", "My younger \\[23\\] sister and I \\[27\\] were both adopted at birth. I'm trans racially adopted (our parents are Caucasian) while she is the same race as our parents. Neither of us are biologically related to each other or our parents. We both had happy childhoods and our parents were always supportive of us. We always knew we were adopted and I never felt that my parents loved us any less than our brother (we have one older brother who is our parents biological child). Neither of us had ever cared to look for our birth parents when we were younger but our parents said that we would be able to when we turned 18.\n\nAbout a year ago though someone suggested to her that she read the Primal Wound. The gist of the book is basically that if you're adopted you will be traumatized for the rest of your life because separation of a baby from the mother is traumatic. I read a bit of it and I didn't care for it and honestly I thought it was bullshit. If the book's hypothesis were true then children whose mothers died in childbirth would be traumatized or those born through a surrogate. \n\nHowever, she took everything she read to heart and basically blamed adoption for all of her problems. She did 23andme and was able to find her birth mother. Her birth mother was nice to her at first but I'm not really sure what went down but she eventually had to tell my sister to keep away. The birth mother had remarried and had done really well for herself and was not interested in the close relationship that my sister wants. From what I understand, she apparently had wanted to keep her but was unable to do so because of financial reasons. She regrets giving up her sister but at this point in her life she has come to terms with it and has decided with her husband (who is not my sisters father) that they can't be there for her as her parents. (apparently my sisters  bio dad died in prison about 15 years ago) \n\nSince then my sister has been very moody. Every time we see each other she pesters me to read the book and we end up fighting about it. All she does is complain about how her life would be so much better if her mother had kept her or if our parents had given her bio mom money so that she could keep her. \n\nFinally last night when we were having dinner together she started her usual complaints. I finally got mad and went off on her telling her that our parents were the best thing that had ever happened. She probably wouldn't have done well with her bio mom and adoption isn't traumatizing and that book completely messed up her life and I wish she hadn't read it. She is now not talking to me. \n\nAITA?", "I'm 23F and he's 24M. Me met through common friends at a house party and instantly hit it off.

He texted me saying he had something to show me and asked if he could come over and I was like \"yeah, sure\" he sounded really excited so I was curious what he had planned, I thought maybe he had been accepted to the course he's applied for. But you all know that wasn't it.\n\nHe shows up at my place and I instantly spot the plastic on his arm so obviously I ask what that is. He says he's gotten a tattoo to celebrate our thee month anniversary and I already felt uncomfortable there but once he unwrapped it and showed me it got way way waaaay worse. In big bold letters he's had my name (including my two middle names) tattooed with some red and pink roses around. It's maybe 20x7 centimeters large.\n\nI got so shocked that the first thing coming out of my mouth was \"you f*cking idiot\" which I know was kinda rough, I just couldn't believe how he'd think that was a good idea. We could have been married for ten years and I would have thought it was stupid but after three (!!) months?? That's just crazy.\n\nHe got really angry at me, calling me ungrateful, that he'd spent so much money on it to make me happy and show me how special I am to him. I told him that tattoo is just making him look like an obsessed weirdo (once again, harsh I know). Then he called me a \"stupid whore\" (he's never used that sort of language with me before) and stormed out the door.\n\nHe hasn't called or texted me once since yesterday and neither have I\n\n\n---> *Uppdate* : he texted me like half an hour ago saying he's given me exactly 24 hours to say I'm sorry and that he's disappointed in me for not doing so, that he \"expected more\" from me and that he really didn't think I was \"just another hoe\".\n\nWith his behaviour lately and all you guys warning me I'm honestly a bit scared. My mom just picked me up and she's taking me back to her place right now, I'm typing this from the backseat. \n\nI've told him over text that we're done and that I don't want him to contact me anymore but he just keeps texting me calling me all sorts of names.

I said sure, since all my clubs (FBLA, Investing Club, DECA) ended a few weeks ago. It's not too serious as of now, and is more of just a fun thing, I guess. For example, a lot of guys are just wearing normal swim trunks, and a lot of girls are just wearing bikinis, even though that's not the official uniform.\n\nAnd that's where the problem comes in. Sarah is a bit insecure of this, and doesn't like that I'm spending every day after school playing water polo with a bunch of fit, half-naked girls. \n\nSo she asked me to quit. I just said I'm not going to, for a few reasons:\n\n1) Water polo is really fun \n\n2) I need to practice swimming in the off-season, and a water polo is a novel, more fun way of doing it than just swimming laps.\n\n3) Her demands are ridiculous and I don't think she should control what I can or can't do because of her jealousy. I don't tell her, for example, not to hang out with her guy friends.

The way these things work is you queue up and wait for a checkout to become free, you don\u2019t approach until the person before you has paid, bagged and walked off. So today I went to my local store. Now after a heavy night out my friend asked me to pick him some bits up whilst I was out, he gave me his card and off I went. I grabbed our items and went to the self service check out. I paid for his items and mine were still in the basket, bagged them and put the items on the floor. A woman rushed over and shoved her stuff on top of mine, I explained I still needed to pay for them items and she huffed at me and asked why I just bagged other stuff and not mine. I was kind of shocked and said I don\u2019t need to explain myself but the items are being paid for separately. She huffed again took her items off mine and carried on standing there with her basket (bare in mind there is about 9 other self service check outs) she mumbled under her breath and continued to huff and this started to make me quite angry and anxious like I was being pressured. So I decided to scan one item, pay for it, bag it, scan another item, pay for it. I did this about 3 times and she tutted called me an asshole and walked to another checkout. I scanned all my items paid and left, giving her a smug look as I left. So reddit, am I really the asshole?\n\nEdit: seems I am getting mixed reactions to this. I think some people don\u2019t quite get British mannerism and the importance of queuing patiently, like no one queues up quite like the British \ud83d\ude02 we literally do it for everything.  Also just to point out there were many opportunities that other checkouts emptied where she would of been next in line so able to take them. She CHOSE to stay whilst making comments.

He refuses again, he is coming soon he says.\n\nI say again, no you can't do that so I proceed to sit down but stop at the last second to not crush his bag with my buttocks. I ask him to.move it.

I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing.

The instructor began by showing how to locate the proper position to perform CPR compressions.  We were instructed to find the armpit and then measure from the armpit to the middle of the chest. That is the location to perform CPR compressions. Simple enough, right?\n\nWrong. A person in class immediately raised her hand and asked, \"Sooooooo....do we need to measure from both armpits to the middle, or can we just measure from one?\" This once again proves the old adage that there are no stupid questions, only stupid people who ask questions. The instructor looked at her dumbfounded and I, unable to help myself, let out a single audible chuckle. Nobody else laughed, and I received a few disapproving glares. But come on...that is some funny shizz.  So I ask you good people of Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: I'm happy to report baby boy arrived and he and mom are healthy, happy and prospering. Thanks for the entertainment folks.", "Let me preface this by saying that I do not want this man fired. He said this is his full-time job and I'm not a revenge person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI (23F) live in a city where the mass transit is pretty good. Occasionally I get a Lyft if I am going somewhere unfamiliar or I need to get there fast.  I was planning on going on a date to a bar a few nights ago, but both of us got out of work late and were pretty tired.  Instead, we planned a spa-night at his place. I decided that since I didn't know how to get from his apartment to the subway, even though they're close, I would get a Lyft since it was getting late.\n\nI got picked up at my house by a male driver who was maybe 30 and there were two other women in the car.  It was a fairly pleasant ride while the other two were there--lots of great conversation about where we were all from, what we all do, etc. I mentioned my date and how excited I was for it. About 5-10 minutes from my drop-off, the other two get out.\n\nImmediately I could feel a massive change in tone and energy in the car. We stopped at a light and he started to turn around to look at me, saying how much he liked me, how great he thought I was, that he could use more people like me around. I mumbled a \"thanks\" and tried to change the subject. I really thought I had made it clear I was not interested, but uncomfortable.\n\nI thought he past my drop-off and I texted my date saying he needed to wait for me in the lobby, then opened the app to make sure he was on track.  I'm not sure if he actually did take a longer route, but we were on track by the time I looked. I was ready to get out if we weren't.\n\nHe pulls up really slowly to the apartment building, asking if \"it was cool if we stay in contact\" and go out. I blurted out that my boyfriend wouldn't like this and ran to the building. He didn't pull away until my date opened the second door on the inside of the building for me.\n\nI told him what happened in detail and he was LIVID. He said I should report this, that it was harassment and that this man was in a power position over me. He was easily twice my size and was driving me around a part of town I was unfamiliar with.  I kept saying no, I didn't want him to get in trouble and I would feel bad. He stood firm and said that if this man had done it before, he would definitely do it again.\n\nIt has been a few days and I still feel really icky about it. It put such a damper on my night. I know it is dramatic, but it took me awhile to come down from it and relax.  All I wanted was to have a nice night with this really great guy, and I was uncomfortable for like an hour before I could completely calm down and enjoy it. I'm not even comfortable enough to use Lyft anymore.\n\nI really don't want to ruin this guys life. WIBTA if I reported this incident to Lyft?\n\nEDIT: I should also say I'm scared to report this since he literally knows where I live now; I didn't say that it was my house, but thats certainly the vibe I would've gotten if I had been the driver.", "My son (10) made a pretty good friend (10) within the last schoolyear. They are pretty inseparable and do everything together. I would arrange playdates for the mom, saying I\u2019d pick both boys up from school and when I\u2019d get there, I\u2019d find out the mom had also made me responsible to pick up the boy\u2019s younger brother (5) too. She says that his feelings get hurt if he also doesn\u2019t have a playdate. When the little boy comes over, my son and his friend tire of him quickly. They don\u2019t want him to play with them and while I try to encourage group play, it\u2019s just a lot on them. They want to play with different things with him. Typically, the little boy ends up following me or my older daughter around. \n\nThis happened quite a few times throughout the school year. I thought it might stop in the summer, but when I went to pick up the 10-year-old, the 5-year-old was ready to go too and how could I say no to him, when he was all ready? He\u2019s just a kid and it\u2019s not his fault his mom is doing this.\n\n If I try to talk to the mom, she just says that the little brother gets insanely jealous and that he loves coming to my house. My son overall doesn\u2019t mind him coming, so long as he stays out of my hair and I can manage it.\n\nNow, my son is having his 11th birthday party. He\u2019s having a simple birthday sleepover with a few friends, including the older brother of this 5-year-old. I talked to the mom and said that it was just for the \u201cbig boys\u201d, and please don\u2019t tell the 5-year-old he could come. I\u2019d be too busy that night to play buffer. She got really offended and tried to say they were a packaged deal. I gently explained that it couldn\u2019t continue. She finally relented, but said that her son was going to be very hurt.\n\nAm I being an ass here? I feel bad, but I feel she\u2019s the only setting her son up for failure here. (Not why I said he couldn\u2019t come, my son doesn\u2019t want him there and I just don\u2019t have to watch him.)", "My gf has an ex that she talks to all the time, which I dont really mind. He lives a few hours away and they talk mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\nEdit: Phrasing, sentence didn't make sense.\n\nEdit 2: so the resounding feedback is that she is cheating on me. Which, I don't believe. The reason I dont believe that is because (like many of you) I thought she was cheating so I looked at their texts. They are all very innocuous and mainly about old friends. Never mentioned meeting up, and he lives 3 hours away. Take that for what its worth friends of the internet.\n\nEdit 3, months later: Turns out you were all right. She was projecting because she was keeping guys on the side. She never \"cheated\" in a strict definition of the word but she was talking to multiple guys. We are broken up and I am happily single. What I have learned is that projection is a huge red flag. Live and learn.", "I saw a similar post here a while ago and I feel like sharing mine too, though I think it's not that much of a deal.\n\n\nI have recently moved in to an apartment with my boyfriend and my 2 year old black cat, Lucifer. Despite naming him Lucifer we also call him Lucy and Lulu. Some of the friendly neighbors visited our place with gifts as a welcome gesture and it did not take long for us to know that one of their 7 year old daugher's name is Lucy. \n\n\nThe mother(who did not visit our place before and probably heard from the other neighbors) had been knocking our door asking us to change the name of our cat because\n\n1. They are christians, and linking my cat name \"Lucifer\", which we also nickname \"Lucy\" to their daughter \"Lucy\" is offensive.\n\n2. The cat is black, the little girl is black too, thus racist.\n\n\nI declined her request as my cat was named even before we moved in, so it was just a coincidence that their names were similar. Whats more, my cat is a strictly indoor cat and nobody would probably hear me calling him \"Lucy\" or \"Lucifer\" outside our apartment, in fact nobody would have known that we owned a cat.\n\n\nThe neighbor is getting rather upset over this and even my boyfriend said that changing Lucifer's name is not a big deal, we could even lie to her that we have already changed his name. I said no, why should I change my cat's name or lie about him changing name when it is really none of her business? I don't want to give in to her over such silly reasons. AITA?\n\n\nUpdate: Lol did not expect so many comments and upvotes. Actually this is jus 1 of the small incidents we have encountered after moving in, I wouldn't have posted here if I didn't see something similar earlier(the Sadie post).

", "TLDR: I (26F) and my gf (30F) has been together for just over a year. A friend who I had one-sided feelings for 5 years ago, planned a trip together with me this weekend, we had invited my gf but she refused to go. Originally it was a trip of three friends. But the third friend backed out. My friend and I still want to go. Everything is booked and paid for. \u2014 but once learning it\u2019s gonna be a trip for two, my gf absolutely refuses for this trip to happen, and instantly told me to cancel. \n\n\u2014-\n\nI (26F) and Friend (27F) has been friends since middle school. Same high school. Same university. We had always been close friends. 5 years ago, I had developed feelings for her, and was promptly rejected. We were/are incompatible and she didn\u2019t return my feelings. We drifted apart for 2 years, I lived out of town for 3. \u2014 but my main little group of friends include my Friend. And she is still one of my closest friends (we had mended the friendship in the recent year). \n\nFor the longest time, we had always talked about taking a skating trip to another city close by. We had done it in first year university and had a great time. We wanted to go skating again. This year I\u2019m finally back in town. We promptly planned it. Invited other people, but they were all busy, and one flaked out. We had invited my gf, she did not want to go. Then we planned the trip for a later weekend in Feb, but my gf wanted to spend that weekend with me instead (even though we live together). And insisted on changing the date of the trip. \n\nSo it was changed to this weekend. When my gf isn\u2019t in town. \u2014- my gf asked us to change it! And my Friend had to rearrange other plans in her life, as had I, to make it work. \n\nThen the third friend flaked. I didn\u2019t tell my gf. It just didn\u2019t occur to me that she\u2019d have a problem with this. I want to go on the trip. So what if it\u2019s a two person trip instead? \u2014 but I didn\u2019t neglect to tell her intentionally. I just didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be an issue with her. Gf never had insecurities about this Friend before. \n\nLast night, she asked me again about the details of the upcoming weekend trip. Fair enough. I was honest. Clarified it was just gonna be two people. \n\nInstantly, gf freaked out. Went berserk. \u2014 saying this is a date instead. A two night three days date. That how could I do this to her. How could I betray her trust like that. \u2014 that this trip I\u2019m taking is akin to cheating. \n\nShe instantly started to set rules and boundaries for my friend and I. Apparently I can no longer take the initiative to talk to her. I cannot hang out with her privately. I am to intentionally drift apart from my friend. \n\nI\u2019m flabbergasted. If I am going to cheat, or had the intention to, it\u2019d be so easy to cover up. Gf isn\u2019t in town. I don\u2019t post on social media. She was even invited to the trip, and, we even changed the date because she wanted more time with me. \u2014 and WHY would I cheat??? If my heart and mind isn\u2019t just set on my gf, I\u2019d have just separated with her. \n\nJust \u2018cause I liked my friend for three months 5 years ago, I have to throw away the friendship and the trip? I can say, without any question, that it\u2019s just pure friendship now. And I do not foresee anything festering. Friend is a friend. \n\nI then refused to cancel the trip. And told my gf we should both reconsider our relationship. She instantly felt personally attacked and is blighted by \u201cYou are considering breaking up with me because of HER?\u201d \n\nNo. I\u2019m considering breaking up with you because of your unreasonable controllingness. Your lack of trust in me. And my sadness that you are forcing me to cut off a good friend. \n\nShe didn\u2019t understand. And she couldn\u2019t stand talking to me anymore. Deleted me via the chatting applications. Told me she will not consider Breaking up with me. I can consider alone. And tell her the results via email. \n\nSo. Here I am. AITA? \n\n\n\nUpdate: \n\nTrip is cancelled. It\u2019s gloomed over and I rather just wallow in sadness over the weekend. I cancelled because: \n\n1. With my gf\u2019s outbursts. I cannot enjoy the trip.I no longer have her blessing. \n\n2. I need to work on my relationship with her. And if I go on this trip, there is no working left. I do not believe she will see past her own insecurities and see it\u2019s just a skating trip. \n\nSo. That\u2019s that. Thank you for all your comments. ", "So there\u2019s this sex toy site we use to buy toys from sometimes which we use one of our joint accounts to pay for. The site has a unique name it appears as on bills mainly for discretion. My husband was sorting out his own personal bills and out of plain curiosity and interest I just looked at one of the slips and noticed that site was on the bill from a while back. It seemed weird that it was on there as we always use our joint account for that stuff. So I did a bit of snooping around the house looking for what it could have been and I found a silicone limp penis (almost like a dildo but limp). When I cross referenced this with the site it turns out to be a toy that guys can wear in their pants to make them seem \u2018bigger\u2019. So I confronted him about this and he was really embarrassed. He said he didn\u2019t do it for anyone but himself because he wanted to feel more masculine and better about himself. Since then things have been a little awkward between us. He seems quite embarrassed and is generally less talkative than he usually is. AITA?", "I'm in my early 20's and into hot chicks dominating me, I'm into ballbusting (you can guess what that is) but I'm more of a light to medium max player of it. I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.", "So basically I've been going to school with this one girl for 5-6 years now, she's always been overweight. This year I think she is at her heaviest. She's always complained about her weight and how people make fun of her for it (not to be but I she's loud when she talks to her friends. \n\nAbout a week ago I walked by her and her friends near my locker, she was red faced and looked like she's been crying alot. One of her friends looked at me and said \"what?!\" Kinda angrily, I turned around to try to just avoid it I guess and she said \"what are you looking at?!\". I sheepishly turned around and said \"if being made fun of for being overweight bothers you so much, maybe it's worth losing some of it\". \n\nAITA? I wasn't trying to be rude or anything but she and her friends were kinda shocked I'd say that.\n\nEdit: not trying to defend myself but I'd just like to clarify that she was upset in this instance about her mother telling her to lose some weight, and she does eat a lot of food even when she's happy and would definitely be full (from what I hear every other day after lunch her stomach is stretched/full)", "For background, I am Australian but I currently live/work in Singapore. I have two houses back home, one of which I have been letting my sister and her family (3 kids) live in almost rent free (just enough to cover property expenses). They've been living there almost 10 years now without any issues.\n\nMy sister is married to a top bloke called Campbell. Great guy, works for a mining company and makes a decent living. My sister is a kindergarten teacher and doesn't make very much. This might be relevant which is the only reason I'm mentioning it.\n\nAnyway, it recently came out that my sister has been having an affair for a while now. Campbell is obviously fucking devastated and the two of them immediately agreed to separate and eventually divorce. Now, the both assumed that being my sister, she should continue living at my house (with the kids) while Campbell rents an apartment. When I found this out I called Campbell and asked whether he was okay with this arrangement, or whether he would prefer to continue living at my house (with the kids) while my sister moves out. He obviously wanted to continue living there with the kids and only moved out because he assumed I'd side with my sister.\n\nSo I tell my sister the new arrangement and she loses her mind over this. I basically told her in no uncertain terms that going forward Campbell will continue living at my house, whether they divorce or not. \n\nMy family thinks I'm being a manipulative asshole for:\n\n1. Not siding with my own sister\n\n2. Inserting myself into \"their\" problems\n\n3. Doing this despite knowing it will help Campbell get primary custody since my sister can't afford to take care of them + pay rent\n\nI take the opposite view: I think I am doing the morally right thing by not letting my relationship with my sister cloud my judgement. In my opinion, Campbell is the one that deserves to continue living there since my sister is the one that ruined the marriage by cheating.\n\nSo yeah, sorry for rambling, AITA?\n\nJust realised I should mention that sister staying at my other property is not possible.", "So, I'm ready to get roasted here but I will accept my judgment. I got married about 6 months ago, and my family offered to pay for most of the wedding. This was a HUGELY generous offer and I appreciated it a lot. I work in public service and there's no way I could have afforded a wedding at all. While I knew that by accepting the money, I really needed to let my family have the final word on a lot of decisions, I had one hold-out request that blew up into a huge fight. \n\nMy parents have a neighbor, let's call him Charlie, who is just complete trash and NOTHING like any of their other friends.  I have nothing to do with him, and if he shows up at their place, I leave. He's racist, he's bigoted, he's exposed himself to women at parties as a \"joke,\" he's grabbed women while drunk, and he's a terrible alcoholic. Inexplicably, this guy is Teflon with my parents' friend group and according to them it would have been unthinkable to snub him. \n\nNow, we fought about this - an ugly fight. Tears were shed. I begged. My dad (he's mean) called me the \"c-word\" (and more) and threatened not to come to my wedding at all. He left me sobbing on the street and told me I was killing my mother because I am such an ungrateful bitch.\n\nI am ... not proud of this but I caved. I was feeling vulnerable. I didn't want all the ugliness, my dad is seriously ill so every fight feels like I can't take it back, and my mom promised that Charlie would be escorted out at the first sign of trouble. I wasn't so sure, particularly because my group of friends is VERY diverse and my husband isn't white, but I trusted her that it would be okay for a few hours and I, according to her, \"wouldn't even know he's there.\"\n\nFast forward to the wedding. Charlie gets rip roaring drunk and starts trying to fight our DJ. He's screaming \"fuck you,\" flipping him off, he's mad I guess because he doesn't like the music? The bartenders cut him off and he's escorted out. I didn't know this at the time because it was all handled so quickly. When I found out, I called the DJ and bartenders personally to apologize, but I'm livid. I'm so embarrassed. I know how easily this could have been worse, it could have just as easily been my husband's family, and I don't know that I would have ever been able to apologize enough. \n\nI am so angry at my parents for bullying me to invite Charlie, especially because he did exactly what I knew he would do and they act like no one saw this coming. AITA because I could have and should have walked away from their offer to pay and sidestepped the issue? Or is it fair of me to be upset because they used a generous offer coupled with a threat to blow up my family and estrange themselves to manipulate me to do something that made me horribly uncomfortable and it caused potentially disastrous consequences?", "Ok I know I\u2019m probably TA, but honestly I feel like I\u2019m justified. \n\nI\u2019ve just returned to work since having my Bub.

He sent out an email reminding people to only eat their food. \n\nThe next day it happened again. FYI I have my name on it. I asked my boss if we could put cameras in the lunch room, he said no. I asked if he would comp my lunch expenses as I had to buy from the local cafe and shits expensive yo! He again said no. I sent out another email and spoke to as many people as I could (about 15 out of the 20 in my office). \n\nThe next day I was feeling more positive. I left a note on my food again stating it was mine and to not touch it. Lunch time comes around again and my food is gone. I was pissed so I threw out everything that was in the fridge. \n\nNo one technically knows it was me, as I haven\u2019t admitted to doing it, just like the jerk off stealing my lunches hasn\u2019t come forward. \n\nThe boss sent out another email threatening written notice for anyone who touches anyone else\u2019s food. My lunch hasn\u2019t been touched since. \n\nMy Husband told me I was an asshole because everyone in my office didn\u2019t deserve to have their lunch ruined because of one person stealing mine.

He has some co-hosts, legit recording equipment, and he has a decent following. I always go to the studio to just sit on the side and watch as he records, but I've noticed that he's started to become a bit different ever since the start of the podcast.\n\nOn a podcast a few weeks ago, the topic was 2016 movies as my boyfriend and his co-hosts revisited some of their favorite and least favorite films of 2016. One co-host brought up Arrival as their favorite film of 2016 and while he was talking, my boyfriend loudly says \"YAWN!\" and he explains that he thought Arrival was boring. My boyfriend then goes into this giant rant about how he hated Arrival, calling it one of the most overrated movies of all time. He says that he looks down on people who like the movie because he claims that they \"think they're smart\" and he says that he's proud of himself for \"seeing past that movie\" and it's \"faux attempts at intelligence\". And whenever someone would try to change the subject, he'd just interrupt them and go right back to talking about how much he hates Arrival.\n\nThen just a few days ago, he was recording another show and the topic was MCU movies. My boyfriend brought up that he thinks Age of Ultron is a \"hidden gem\" and \"massively overlooked masterpiece\". One of his co-hosts scoffed when he said those things and that set off my boyfriend. He starts attacking the co-host for his taste in movies and started saying stuff like \"Just because I have a better understanding of the art of film-making, it doesn't mean you have to be jealous of me.\" That was actually enough for the co-host to just walk out in the middle of the show and my boyfriend said \"That's fine, I only want to talk to true auteur's of film on this show.\" \n\nAnd just yesterday, I asked him if we could see Shazam together, but he simply responded with \"I deserve better than those DC movies.\" I confronted him and told him that he needs to stop acting like he's smarter than everyone over his taste in film and he said \"Truth hurts, doesn't it?\" And it's like this a lot. Whenever I'm watching a movie he doesn't like, he'll just scoff and say \"Typical\". I'm thinking of breaking up with him, but I also feel weird about dumping him over him having differing views on film. What do you think?", "My (25f) BF (25m) has a PS4 and a couple dozen games, he bought it new 3 months ago, but with no warranty so he's made a conscious effort to keep it in good condition, including packing it away in the box when he doesn't think he'll use it for a while. He did this yesterday, putting the console in the box and then putting the box into a larger plastic storage container with all his games, as he's out of town for next week. He left the container under our bed, but the side was poking out so you could see the playstation box through the plastic.\n\nToday my sister (31f) had a few work meetings, one after the other, over about 5 hours, and rang me in a panic, saying the sitter called in sick and she needed someone to watch Nephew (11 years old). I reluctantly agreed, and she dropped him by. He wanted to watch TV so I gave him the remote and got on with my work. Couple hours go by without incident, but then Nephew got hungry. I went to the kitchen to cook for him. About a minute later I went to check on him and he was gone. I found him upstairs in mine and BF's room, digging through the container with the PS4 inside. By the time I'd gotten there he'd taken out the box and a few games and I asked him what he thought he was doing.\n\nHe said he was bored and wanted to play. I said no. He did the whole \"I'll tell my mum you're being mean to me\". I said \"tell her what you want, still not happening\". Nephew, on realising I wasn't about to let him use it, tried to run past me, carrying the PS4 in his arms, presumably to hook it up to the TV downstairs. IDK what happened exactly, if he tripped or lost his grip or what, but he dropped the PS4, right at the top of the stairs. It fell down the flight of stairs, and when we checked it it's a mess of cracked plastic and wiring.\n\nI clean up, give Nephew his lunch, sit him in front of the TV. The whole time Nephew is saying that I should have just let him use it. I rang BF to let him know and he's obviously mad/sad but says that it's fine when it clearly isn't. He asks me to look up prices for a new one and it's more than we can afford rn.\n\nSister arrives, asks if Nephew was any trouble, and I tell her about the console. She immediately says I should have watched him better. I tell her that I was cooking and that I watched him today for 6 hours, as well as countless other times I've babysat, and never once expected payment, but in this case it's \"you break it, you buy it\", and I show her the prices I got when I searched for a new console. She says I'm being unreasonable and she's not replacing it because she didn't do it and I was watching Nephew, plus she's not paying for a new one when BF had his for a couple months already.\n\nAITA?\n\nINFO: BF has previously told Nephew that he isn't allowed on it and due to lack of warranty BF treats the playstation like it's made of glass.\n\nINFO: BF bought his console from a friend for \u00a3229 and it sounds like the friend had had it for a while and just never used it, which is why the warranty was expired. The replacement I found was used in \"fair condition\" for \u00a3129 but the page I showed my sister contained the \u00a3129 one and some significantly cheaper ones that would have been fine.\n\nAlso: When I said \"new one\" I meant one that isn't a heap of wires and plastic, not a brand new pristine condition PS4.\n\nUpdate: BF complained to his brother, who offered him a free xbox and some games. IDK what type but it's whichever one was before the latest one as the brother upgraded to the latest console.\n\nUpdate 2: BF is saving up for a new ps4. His birthday is in September and his grandparents still send him a card with \u00a350 in it which is already nearly half and he can budget for the rest. He says that this is probably a good thing (losing the playstation and me arguing with my sister) because now we have a reason to never babysit again.", "My girlfriend is 20. I\u2019m 27. \n\nWe\u2019re currently on vacation together with her parents. We were all on a fairly empty beach by our rented bungalow. My girlfriend fell asleep, and because it was sunny out and my girlfriend is very pale, her dad suggested that she should be brought inside. He carried her inside which is the first thing I thought was weird. He came back out for another half hour and I spent time with him and her mom. Then he said he was getting tired, and he was heading inside for a nap. Her mom and I just kind of nodded and continued chatting for awhile before we went back inside as well. When we went inside, he was sleeping with her in the bed, spooning her. This is something that we do so I couldn\u2019t help but feel kind of creeped out. Later when my girlfriend woke up and her parents weren\u2019t around I explained to her that I thought it was bizarre they were sleeping in the same bed. She insisted that I\u2019m making the situation something it\u2019s not and that it\u2019s not weird at all. I told her I found it \u201cinappropriate\u201d and she called me an asshole for it. AITA, or is it just weird?\n\nEdit: Some people are asking for more info.\n\nWe\u2019ve been dating for a year. I\u2019ve met her parents on several occasions and we\u2019re all just about close enough now that we\u2019re taking a vacation together. I always knew she was a daddy\u2019s girl (not that she self-professed this title, it\u2019s just what I picked up on), but I feel like this is what crossed the line for me. They\u2019re not really \u201cweird\u201d otherwise, but they\u2019re obviously very close. A little too close IMO. They\u2019re super cuddly. When we were waiting to enter a restaurant the other night she leaned into her dad\u2019s chest and he started stroking her hair. Other than that there\u2019s nothing super unusual. Just typical exchanges of parental affection like hugs and sometimes kisses on the cheek. I have yet to see her cuddle her mom the way she does her dad. \n\nMy train of thought is she\u2019s 20, a fully grown adult. Past a certain age cuddles with your dad shouldn\u2019t be such a public display of affection.\n\nSome more info: \n\nShe\u2019s typically mature, which is why I find her behavior around him unusual. Until now if I had to describe her, I would say she\u2019s independent. However, when they\u2019re together, she seems dependent. Her behavior is almost regressive. She\u2019s not the mature adult I\u2019m used to being around, but more like a child. When we\u2019re all crossing the street together he says \u201cwait\u201d or \u201ccareful\u201d and sometimes holds his arm out in front of her. She isn\u2019t bothered by this at all, where 99% of adults would be. He babies her to the point where she can\u2019t even carry a bag by herself and he\u2019ll pick up everything for her. Again, no objections. Meanwhile, if I were to do anything like this, I have no doubt she would tell me not to worry about it, that she can do it herself.\n\nYes, she is an only child.", "It feels weird to type but next year i will be 30. I have been married since i was 22. My wife is the same age.\n\n3 years ago she had just beaten cervical cancer. She had surgery, and she was a soldier throughout the whole process. I am very proud of her.\n\nAfter the surgery we didnt have sex for obvious reasons and i accepted that. However she still gave me oral sex frequently. I would try to please her as best i could without hurting her but its tough.\n\nEventually her sex drive disappeared completely. She just did not want to be intimate anymore. This has been going on for two years. She will give me oral sex on my birthday or special occasions but thats it.\n\nI am still very attracted to my wife. I love her very much. I do not want to give up sex for the rest of my life.\n\nI have talked to her numerous, countless times and shes just not into it anymore. Its not a pain thing but a desire thing.\n\nI have been reading up on open relationships, basically just flings to satisfy my needs as a man while still living and loving my wife. She was not receptive of the idea at all to say the least.\n\nCrying, yelling, you name it. She doesnt understand why id even ask. Even after i explain. I want to grow old with her but i dont want to be old now and give up sex.\n\nI dont even know what i couldve done different in this besides just shut up and be celibate forever. ", "I've been using Tinder for a few weeks now. My profile picture is a picture of me at the store that I used to work at. A customer came in with a pet pigeon and let the bird sit on my arm, and then I asked him to take the picture with my phone. I didn't use any filters. You can see me from my midriff up to the top of my head, but tbh I was wearing a sweater. \n\n\nI am a 5'8, 162 lbs female, btw. \n\n\nI met this guy on Tinder and we hit it off. He was really funny and we had some hobbies in common. We agreed to go on a date downtown, to look at pigeons, because he said that he also liked them. When we met he was completely different from how he was over chat. He didn't say anything to me on his own and just answered questions with simples yesses and nos. He seemed angry the whole time and left the date after about an hour, saying he was supposed to meet his friend.\n\n\nI thought that maybe he was shy in real life, and texted him afterwards to thank him for the date and ask him if he had an omay time. He didn't reply for a few days but this morning I got this text:\n\n\n>just a headsup not everyone is into big girls, u should rly let guys know ahead of time so they dont get put on the spot. Just my advise. Hope u find what ur looking for, best wishes.\n\n\nI feel really embarrassed after reading this text. I didn't mean to put anyone 'on the spot'. I know I'm not thin, but I'm also not *that* heavy. It never occurred to me that this was something I had to disclose before meeting someone. But I do remember reading some posts online where people were similarly disappointed that a date was bigger than they let on. Am I one of those deceptive dates? AITA?\n\n\nEdit: everyone keeps asking me about the picture I uploaded and if it's from weird 'angles' and shit... no. I thought that was pretty obvious as I said before that a customer took the picture of me with his pet bird. I just put it up because people are always saying that 'action pictures' are better than posed ones and I like birds \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc26\n\nOtherwise I want to thank everyone for their input, even those that think I'm the asshole.

She recently took a break from her job because she's too tired to work and it is a high risk pregnancy.\n\nI work as the managing director of a company and my job stresses me out. I only take important calls. My wife doesn't generally call me but I do talk to her whenever she does. She calls if she wants to talk or if she wants me to bring anything for her to eat. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, she called me and started crying. She wanted me to come home ASAP. I was shit scared and rushed home cancelling all appointments for the day. And when I got home, I was really surprised. She was crying because the neighbours dog died. I'm not even kidding. I was really scared but it was nothing. \n\nThis has been happening for a couple of weeks. She calls me and asks me to come over. But it always ends up being nothing. I really can't take this stress.

WIBTA here?", "My grandfather passed a month ago, shortly after my (21F) 21st birthday. My dad left when I was 7, and my mum passed away when I was 11, shortly after my grandma. My granddad took me in straight away despite his age, even though he was still mourning both his wife and daughter.\n\nThough still deadly sharp, his physical condition wasn't great in his last few years. I'd express my worry for him sometimes, but he'd always tell me to get lost and assure me he'd \"see me through 'til 21.\" He was the light of my life.\n\nWhen he died, I didn't shed a tear. It's hard for me to explain why, but he was still giving sass on his deathbed, and pinched my arm and told me to not cry because he wasn't crying.\n\nAfter I left, I received a text from my aunt later that evening that she was disappointed at me for not being visibly mournful and apparently him telling me not to was a very poor response. I ignore this, since we were all grieving.\n\nI didn't return to the house for three days to avoid being alone again. When I did return, I found the shelves empty, bits of furniture missing, and photos taken from the walls. I confronted my aunt immediately, who after some arguing returned most of what was taken.\n\nMaybe she didn't think I'd notice, but not only had she taken both my granddad's and his dad's service medals, she had sold them as well.\n\nLuckily, I found the selling post on Facebook quickly enough and the man who bought them was happy to return them to me. I refunded man, and don't plan on asking my aunt for repayment since I'm just so glad to have them back in the first place. I did not confront my aunt about this.\n\nThe funeral arrives, and I'm straight away hounded for going through with a cremation. I keep telling her that it was my granddad's decision, not mine, but apparently this contradicted his Catholic values (???)\n\nI'm an extremely mellow person, but this continued into the gathering afterwards. She told others how selfish I was for not letting her take any of his belongings, and how she thought I pushed him into signing his house over to me.\n\nI was soon invited to sit among a table of some of his old friends, at which my aunt was sat too. I tried to not pay her any mind, but the conversation soon devolved and she slipped up and told the table that I hadn't even let her take a single medal.\n\nI lost myself at this, and erupted into a slurry of profanities. My aunt immediately starts crying, and I seize moment to call her out on her selling the medals in the first place. \n\nI'm not sorry for the things I said to my aunt, but I'm deeply ashamed of my behaviour given the setting. Some people have approached me offering support, to which I have not replied, but I have this immense feeling of guilt in my stomach that I can't shake.\n\nI know for sure that I overreacted, but AITA? Should I apologise to each attendee individually? I'm in a terrible way at the moment and my mind is all over the place.

Yes, a snorting laugh with nasal flaring and mouth covering. \n\nI asked what she was laughing at and she said \u201coh just your... uhh... undies... cause of the pattern\u201d (which was a pretty plain checkered pattern so how could that be funny?)\n\nI should probably also explain that I have been self conscious about my size since as far as I can remember. Basically my circumcision was botched as a child and as a result I have an abnormally curved penis with visible scarring and to this day, pain during intercourse.\n\nSo this is why I believe that she was laughing at my genitals.\n\nAfter the experience and after I payed I asked to speak to the manager (who turned out to be the owner) and explained what happened.\n\nI then watched the employee get fired on the spot and saw her grab her belongings and run out of the salon muttering something about \u201clawyer\u201d under her breath.\n\nAm I the asshole for complaining and getting her fired because I found her reaction hurtful and insulting?\n\nEdit: I am not trying to argue about the cost of women\u2019s services, I was legitimately ignorant as to the pink tax.

I inform her she's free to do what she wants with her body but I'm not going to be responsible for the baby and if she gives birth I fully expect her to raise it alone and make sacrifices for its well being. That didn't sit well with her and she still wants me to raise it when she's in college. I tell her I didn't sign up for this when taking her in and she's either to abort or have the baby on the streets. Cold? Heartless? Sure.

His commute is 5 minutes, mine is 10. \n\nThree weeks ago I switched jobs and now we both start work at 7 am (I can really walk in around 7:15 though). It used to be 8:30. I'm quick getting ready so I can be out the door in 20-30 minutes. This means I'd ideally wake up and shower at 6. My boyfriend though, wakes up at 5:40 and doesn't get out of the bathroom until 6:20. Every single day. That's fine. Not even an issue, still time for me to shower and get to work.\n\nExcept. For whatever reason. And I will never be able to understand this. \n\nHe doesn't shower until 6. Ever. Never ever. \n\nBut he turns the freaking water on at 5:40 when he goes in the bathroom and let's it freaking run until 6 am. He uses the time to trim his beard (every freaking day), go pee, wake up, check his phone, whatever. \n\nWhich not only is a tremendous waste of money and a fucking strain on the environment, but it means that my showers are ICE COLD. I've complained a billion times. He says that it's his routine and he's been doing it since way before he met me. \n\nHe basically said that if I don't like it, wake up and take a shower before him. Which would mean waking up a full hour earlier than necessary considering there is plenty of time to get ready after him. \n\nI complained about it for two weeks, then woke up one week ago today and checked for hot water and it made me so mad that he'd done it again that I told him that I'll no longer be spending the weekdays with him because I'm not going to continue to inconvenience myself and start every morning off of a bad note with an ice cold shower over something that could easily be fixed. \n\nI offered to spend Friday and Saturday evenings with him, but have made it clear I'm going home every Sunday afternoon.

I get there early and wait for her outside and she shows up much larger than in her pics, but she's still cute and I'm not a picky man (plus tmi... dat ass). I figured that the pictures she'd used were from last year and that's fine. Not all my pics are recent either, I just threw up my best. \n\nThe date was actually awesome. The crush is still strong even as I'm typing it but... fuck I was suspicious, alright? That whole twin thing was a weird red? yellow? flag, especially how she talked about her sis. Nothing bad, just... dismissive? Idk how to describe it. Anyways, so I check Facebook and the pictures she had used were from her sister's profile (not fully public but one was her profile pic and another one was visible on there so I'm guessing the rest are hers too). And I'm not sure how to feel now. On one hand, I like her. On the other, she's using her sisters pics to get dates and that's... weird?? But they're twins so she legit would look just like her sis if she lost a bit of weight so it's not really lying??? And I get why she did it, we all got flaws we wanna pretend aren't there, but????\n\nI asked my coworker's their opinion and it's divided as fuck (one lad said I was fat-shaming/lacking empathy), so since I found this sub recently I figured I'd ask here.

Well lately Bill had some financial emergencies and basically drained his savings and is afraid that in a few months he won't be able to make his house payments. \n\nBill's son Ned is my age.  We grew up together and were pretty close until a few years ago when he withdrew from a lot of his social circles.  We still talk and hang out occasionally, but nothing like we used to.  Ned hasn't had a job since he was 18 and has lived off an allowance from Bill in exchange for doing chores around the house since his mother is too physically ill to do much around the house anymore.  Bill has admitted to me that life would be so much easier if Ned would just get even a part time job to help out a bit with the bills, but Ned just refuses.\n\nWell as Bill was telling me about his financial trouble I remembered Ned's rather large collection of Magic The Gathering cards.  We used to play a lot and a few months ago I remember going through his binder of his rarest and most valuable cards.  For example to those of you who know MTG he has a full playset of most of the original Alpha/Beta dual lands, a couple power nine cards, and a bunch of others.  His entire collection is easily worth over $100,000.  \n\nI told Bill about this and he didn't believe me at first.  Thought I was just making a joke, but I sat him down and explained that with how well he's taken care of those cards over the years they are probably mostly in good condition and worth hundreds if not thousands for certain cards.  Bill just sorta sat there stunned for a minute before going back to his office.\n\nWell he must have said something to Ned because I got a message on Facebook from Ned where he told me that I was a piece of shit for telling his dad about the cards and that he's now harassing him and threatening to kick him out if he doesn't either find a job or sell the cards.  I told him that he should probably get a job then and blocked him because I didn't want to be attacked anymore.\n\nPart of me feels justified because Ned really should get a job and help Bill out, but then again was it none of my business?

We live in rural Australia, so seeing an emu egg is not that big a deal, but then she told me she found it on a \"mound\" in the bush and I'm like holy shit is this an actual live emu in here? She just shrugged. I said it was fucked up to just take an egg that had a chick in it. She told me she thought it was \"abandoned\" and she was gonna try to get it to hatch.\n\nNow at this point I pretty much washed my hands of the situation. I didn't like having this egg around but I wasn't gonna sabotage my living situation over it. She would keep it in her room under a heat lamp (she has a pet lizard that needs one), so I'd hardly see it.\n\nNow, one day I come home from work and I'm completely wrecked cause I work on my feet all day.

Of course I end up falling asleep lying on the couch.\n\nFlash forward to a couple hours later and I wake up to Claire prodding me in the shoulder. I open my eyes and she is glaring straight at me, holding the egg right in my face. There is a tiny chink poked out of it ad the baby emu's beak is legit coming through. I scream and ask her why the fuck she is holding a hatching ANIMAL in my face. She tells me that she left the egg in the U-shaped cushion to \"incubate\" and that by sleeping on it for ages I had \"hatched\" it.\n\nShe said it was the egg's \"cooling period\" and by sitting on it I caused it to hatch premature. I told her she she should \"cool HER period\" and that she didn't know what she was talking about. I think she was just mad that I hatched the egg and not her.\n\nNow she is talking about me LEAVING THE APARTMENT (the lease is in her name) over this.\n\nI feel like it was an honest mistake and she shouldn't have stolen the egg and LEFT IT ON THE COUCH in the first place.

My mother and him had a son, and he was never abused. I left the house when I was 18 and moved out of the country but kept in touch with my family sporadically. \n\nOver the years, my stepfather changed a lot, attending AA meetings (he has not had a drink in 15 years) and has expressed his regrets for treating us the way he did. I thought I got over my childhood issues and could move on with my life, until a recent incident : last September, my sister, half-brother and I were summoned to a family meeting. There, my stepfather announced that he had contacted a lawyer to ensure that when he dies, his money would not end up in my sister\u00b4s and my pockets. \n\nBasically, according to the law, if he dies before my mother, she gets half of his estate and my half-brother gets the other half. And then, when my mother dies, what she owns gets divided into 3 equal parts going to her 3 children. But my stepfather sees that as unfair and he does not want the part she\u00b4d get when he dies to go to anybody else but to his son. He asked my sister and I to sign a letter the lawyer wrote which said we would give our part of the will to our half-brother.\n\nOf course, we refused. My brother looked embarrassed but did not express any objection. My mother, as always, was silent. Seeing how we would not sign it, my stepfather asked us to think about it.\n\nFast forward and here comes Christmas, and we are all again reunited. The subject comes up and my stepfather becomes very irritated when we tell him we would not budge. That same night, all the abuse I suffered as a child started to resurface and the next morning, I decided I was going to pack my bags and leave. My stepfather was not there so my mother took the brunt of my anger : I told her that I would never forgive her for not protecting us, that she was as guilty as he was and that I was going to do something that I should have done when I was 18 : break up with them and never see them again. \n\nMy sister respects my decision but my brother said I was being too harsh and asked me to reconsider. Apparently my mother and stepfather are devastated by my decision and have tried to reach out to me, but I am very reluctant to accept them back into my life. I don\u00b4t think I could ever forgive them. And it is not even about the money, I would actually prefer they donate everything instead of starting this drama.\n\nEDIT : the response to my post has been so overwhelming that I cannot answer everyone directly. Thank you so much for all your advice and kind words of support, I really did not expect this. Some people said my header \u201cbreaking up with my mom\u201d was weird, and I agree I should have worded it differently. I\u2019m new on Reddit and still have a bit to learn, and obviously English is not my first language.\nFor those who said they think I only care about the money : I don\u2019t. It is not even my money to start with. And it\u2019s not the point. It is about a stepfather who decides to be a father when it is time to control, beat, punish, torture and assault, who said that he regrets everything he has done but then bails out when he has a chance to treat us like his own.\nAnd yes, I have a biological father, who remarried long ago and has children with his new wife. Me, my sister and his wife will inherit from him, as well as my other brothers from that relationship. And my brothers (and my stepmother\u2019s son from her first marriage) will inherit from their mother (my stepmother) and we won\u2019t, which is only fair as we haven\u2019t been raised by her. I have a good relationship with my father but he has lived in Spain with his Spanish wife for over 30 years so we don\u2019t see each other as often as we\u2019d like. I told him about everything and he is stunned. Himself as a stepdad he cannot even imagine treating his stepchildren differently to his own blood.\nSome asked, what if my mother dies first? She has almost nothing to her name, but what little she has will go 1/2 to my stepfather, and the rest to my brother, sister and I.  And then when he dies, we get nothing, which is fair enough as it\u2019s the law.\nThanks again everyone, you cannot even imagine how much you helped.", "My sister and I are twins (35) and she has a 16 year old son. I'm an openly gay man, and my whole family knows and loves my partner. A few months ago, when my nephew came for a visit, he came out to me as gay. He said there was a boy at his school that he's in love with and that they've been together for about 2 months.\n\nHe said he hasn't spoken to his parents about it and asked me to keep it a secret and I said no problem. Then he started asking me all sorts of questions, about dating and love, about being gay, about me and what it was like coming out 15 years ago, about my partner, and at the end he got enough courage to ask me about sex. I told him everything I deemed was important and necessary for him to know and asked if he was thinking about sleeping with his boyfriend. He said yes, so I gave him some concrete advice concerning lube and condoms and whatnot.\n\nAnyway, it was a pleasant and normal conversation, he seemed very happy and that was that. Some time later, he decided to come out, last weekend, during a family lunch. His parents and grandparents were there, his sister, myself and my partner. He had a little speech about what a great family we are and how lucky he is seeing how much everyone accepts me and my partner, and knowing he would be equally loved and accepted.\n\nAfter lunch, he was helping his mom in the kitchen and (this was all told me to me by my nephew; I wasn't there personally) my sister asked him if he was seeing someone. He told her about his boyfriend and she said \"Don't go doing anything silly! Do we need to have a chat about the birds and the bees?\" And he said there was no need since he talked to me already.\n\nMy sister flipped out. She came out to the porch, pulled me inside and started screaming at me that what the fuck was I thinking talking to her kid about sex. That he's only 16 and I was only encouraging him to do it. I said that if he had decided to do it, he could have done it without asking me anything first. Then she backtracked and said it was not my place, that I am not his parent and that herself or her husband should have been the ones to talk to him. I said they probably don't know much about gay sex, and she got even angrier and demanded I tell her what I told him. I only said that she was being ridiculous.\n\nAs a result of all this, my nephew is now grounded (because my sister and her husband don't want him having sex?) and I'm not getting my calls answered. My partner thinks that maybe, just maybe, I should have advised my nephew to talk to his parents before talking to him about anything. But I think that's silly. What kid wants to talk to their parents about sex??  I don't think I'm an asshole, my sister and brother in law do, and my partner is neutral. What do you think?", "My SO and I are ready to make our 5 year relationship official.\n\n\nA bit of background, we met online and were long distance for 3 years before spending 2 years together travelling back and forth. We are planning a K1 visa and are ready to start the 90 days this year for a September wedding.\n\n\nHis BIL was in the Marines 8 years ago and always wears his uniform to special occasions. I straight up said I would not allow this as this Wedding is a celebration of love and committment and not a \"oh you fought for the country.\" I would prefer if we kept any type of war, fighting, negativity away from our day. \n\n\nHis BIL is causing a fuss, and as you can tell im not from the US but my husband to be has my back on this. This day of ours, we want it to be about love and us. Even his wife is rolling her eyes.\n\n\nAITA for not understanding his BIL's uniform? \n\n\n", "I got onto quite a packed train, but not too packed in that seating space is tight but there's plenty of standing room. \n\nI sit next to a kid with his father who are about 8/9 years old and 40 respectively. Then the kid starts saying stuff like \"I don't want to sit next to you, and asks his dad to move.\" The dad refuses and the kid goes on \"I don't like black people, they're scary... they're bad people etc\". The kid starts arguing with his dad and muffles in a \"but you\" as his dad shuts him up.\n\nNot that this matters but, I'm actually quite good looking, slim and dressed in casual business wear. So there really wasn't anything I could have done to actually scare this kid. \n\nAnyways, I give this kid a death stare and he starts to shit himself. As I'm about to speak to him, I give up and turn to his father. Then I start to berate him and what he's teaching his child. In effect, I called him a bad parent and a racist along with some other choice words. Father explodes and starts yelling \"how dare I speak to him like that?\", calls me \"unemployed waste of space\" and other defensive remarks. Things start to heat up, kid starts to cry, and then I walk away. \n\nI asked my siblings about it and she said it might not be the dad's fault. Her kids, although younger, built their own perception and were pretty afraid of the darker members of our extended family they didn't see as much. It was only until they went to school and made friends that it all went away. \n\nSo now, I'm not sure if IATA for calling out the dad and berating him in front of his kid.\n\nIATA?", "I'm a 8th grade teacher at a public school in Montana and my school is mostly white but there's 3 black students in my class. One day there's a heated argument I'm not sure how it started but one of my black students called a white student a nigger. I told him that was enough and we don't use that sort of racist language at school (or anywhere i hope). He gets sent to the principal's office and he gets a detention. A lot of students then started yelling at me saying that i shouldn't punish him for that because he's black. They say he has the right to say that because he's black and i shouldn't punish him for doing so.", "Hi everyone! Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\nEdit: Lots of good responses from both point of views. I think it\u2019s important for me to convey why it upsets me, how it causes me anxiety, and focus on staying calm in those situations. It\u2019s equally as important to understand how she feels (having a set time maybe causes her anxiety?) and her thoughts on resolving it. Wedding may or may not have been the best event for this, but told friends she was at the doctor because she felt sick but still wanted to make sure she could come support them at the reception. Also, this is the exception to how we\u2019ve handled disagreements. She\u2019s a lovely person. ", "I worked with this guy Andy for five years. He\u2019s arrogant, thinks he\u2019s always right and treats lower-ranked co-workers horribly. He was \u2018nice\u2019 to me and our other co-managers, but we all knew how he\u2019d power trip our staff ranked friends. His former co-workers from his previous jobs don\u2019t have a lot of good things to say about him either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuffice to say we were\u2026 *not saddened* by his sudden resignation last month over sexual harassment allegations. A newly-hired staff member, Jenny, went straight to head office HR to complain that he told her to meet him at a cafe for a \u2018mentoring session\u2019 where he asked questions about her sex life and \u2018joked\u2019 that she owes him a kiss if he can get her promoted to a higher position. HR was pissed, called Andy in for a meeting, and the next day he said his goodbyes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAndy decided to put up his own business instead of looking for another job. He has been calling some of my co-workers to help him get in touch with our clients who can become his buyers or suppliers, and one of my co-managers mentioned that Andy wants to talk to me and ask if I can introduce him to my client Frank. Frank owns a manufacturing company and Andy is hoping that I can help him negotiate a discount for products he wants to purchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not want to do this at all. I have been handling Frank\u2019s account since he became a client of our company eight years ago and I have built a great relationship with him - I don\u2019t want to tarnish my credibility by being associated with Andy. The way I know him, something will piss him off at one point and he will act all high and mighty on Frank\u2019s employees, or God forbid he might even harass them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday Andy called me but I didn\u2019t answer because I was expecting that he would ask me to introduce him to Frank. When I told my co-workers about this, they told me that I maybe should consider helping Andy, and that two of our other co-workers have already introduced him to their clients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey said that while Andy was an asshole when we worked with him, he is now a man who is trying to build a livelihood to support his young children, and the kids should not be punished for their father\u2019s wrongdoings. They also said that we should give Andy a chance, maybe he has learned his lesson and is trying to become a better person. Another friend was concerned about the fact that I still had a lot of hate for Andy even though he\u2019s no longer my co-worker and is basically out of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole or are my co-workers just too kind?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Holy shit, I was gone for 6 hours and now this is on the front page. I'm grateful to everyone who took the time to weigh in and it's a relief to me that majority think I'm NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to clear a few things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, I am sure that things happened exactly as Jenny said. Andy did not deny it to HR. He reasoned that he asked questions about sex because the mentoring portion of the 'meeting' was done and they were just chatting as acquaintances. Thankfully HR did not let it slide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, I'm glad a lot of you pointed out privacy concerns related to banking regulations. I'm sure there are official rules about this, though in my company we often forget these rules because in practice we become quite close to our clients and basically become their friends so it's so easy to call them and say \"Hey, someone is asking if he can buy five tons of pork\" or something like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, of course I don't know if Andy can or has changed, but before he resigned he was adamant that he did nothing wrong to Jenny and that he's just a victim of #MeToo gone too far. And that's not very encouraging.", "There are a lot of moving parts to this story, but here\u2019s a brief backstory. \n\nEvery year since I was a child thanksgiving has been held at grandmas. In 2012 my step uncle took advantage of me being blacked out drunk, came into the room I was passed out in, and molested me. Took years to get over it. My whole family still talks to him. As if it never happened. Pretty sure no one believes me. This man lives in another state. \n\nSo fast forward to this year and a week before thanksgiving grandma calls to give me a heads up that this man will be in town this year. So obviously, myself and my husband and two kids won\u2019t be going. I am the one who has to rearrange my plans, my family has to miss out. Not him. Which I think is just mind blowing... but moving forward. \n\nMy mom is torn. She feels bad for grandma but also wants to see me and her grandkids. So she decided to hold thanksgiving at her boyfriends house for her immediate family. She tells me to be there at 5, but that I can come over whenever. I\u2019m tasked with desserts so I spend my day baking pies and wrangling my twins to get everyone ready. \n\nWe arrive at 5:30ish. Late as usual. It\u2019s a kid thing. Things are going great. Food is delicious. We decided to play cards against humanity and I leave to run home and grab it really quick. While I\u2019m gone husband calls to say my mom, sister, brother, and the boyfriend and left to grandmas but will be back soon. TWO god damn hours pass and they still aren\u2019t back. They\u2019ve been gone longer then they were there meanwhile we are in this house with two other people we don\u2019t really know. The roommate of the boyfriend and another girl. I\u2019m furious. \n\nSo I decided we are leaving. I pack everyone up and text my mom as we get in the car and she says they are almost there. She also sends another text that was a little garbeled but said that I\u2019m not leaving because we are going to get.. and I quote, \u201ctore up from the floor up.\u201d Let that sink in for a minuet. My MOM, who has never said that in her life, is speaking to me like a 17 year old thot. What in the actual fuck? So they show up and she is wasted. We are all outside and I say three times we are leaving just because I want to go. She pushes for an answer and I blow up. I tell her it\u2019s complete bullshit she left in the middle of OUR thanksgiving to go to grandmas. Like why didn\u2019t she go earlier in the day?? It\u2019s bullshit that she assumes I\u2019d want to get drunk on this day. I don\u2019t drink on thanksgiving. I haven\u2019t since 2012 because I CANT. I\u2019m always the DD and I prefer it that way. Too much anxiety. \n\nMy bitch ass sister decided to pipe up and says \u201cbut we moved thanksgiving for you!\u201d And that\u2019s where shit hit the fan. I didn\u2019t ASK for that. I asked to see them in a different day. They didn\u2019t move thanksgiving FOR me, they moved it BECAUSE of me. Because it\u2019s awkward for everyone apparently. I hear my sister loudly apologize to her boyfriend for having to witness such a monstrosity as her black sheep sister, and I get in the car. We drive away and I haven\u2019t heard from my family since. I ruined everyone\u2019s thanksgiving. I feel extremely angry at my family, but I also feel guilt. I have no idea why. AITA? \n\nEdit 1: spelling. Sorry, on mobile and type all angry and fast to get it out. \n\nEdit 2: Holy Support! First off, to all of those who suspect karma farming, I promise you that is not the case. I don\u2019t have much karma. This is my very first post that has done this, and I didn\u2019t intend for it to. Secondly, trauma guilt is a thing. I wish I would have posted the issue with my uncle and family years ago. It would have saved me a lot of questioning my own sanity. I feel validated, yes! But I came here to check my self to make sure I wasn\u2019t actually the asshole. Because it wasn\u2019t clear until now that I truly Am NTA! Thank you to everyone for the love and supporting comments! I needed to hear this so badly! \n\nEdit 3: Answer to the \u201chow did you know if you were blacked out.\u201d I posted this is in the comments but I guess after awhile people don\u2019t read all the way down. \n\nQuite the personal story,  but I\u2019m in a place I can talk about it so okay.\n\nThe next morning I had frames of memory that I original felt like were a dream. The whole thing is foggy. He approached me the next morning and asked me if I remembered. I said something like \u201cuh no\u201d and he told me that I had sucked his dick. I told him there was no way. Literally used the line \u201ceven if you were Channing Tatum\u201d there was no way. I remember that clear as day. That afternoon he left and sent me a text telling me that I better not tell anyone. That if I did we would both loose or marriages. I spent a good 4 months pretty fucked up. Going over those frames of memory, trying to make sense of it. I felt dirty. I felt like maybe I had been wrong. Maybe I didn\u2019t remember right.\n\nThrough counseling those frames became a little bit clearer. I was walked through accepting what happened that night, being reminded of key details that proved to my brain that I was not at fault. Details like my husband walked me into the bedroom to put me to bed because I was drunk. He took of my shoes, tucked me in, and closed the door. I remember that. At some point this uncle open the door. Came in, uninvited. THAT is the key I hold to reminding myself I am not at fault and I should not feel dirty or guilty. Lots of therapy.\n\n", "Hi everyone!\n\nI go to the same place for breakfast every day and get an omelette.  It\u2019s cafeteria style where you get your food then bring it to a cashier where they look at/ask what\u2019s on your plate and ring you up accordingly. \n\n\nA few days ago there was a cashier I\u2019ve never seen before. It\u2019s pretty busy when I go and they try to whisk you through the line and take payment as quickly as possible. She looked at my plate, rang me up for \u201coatmeal\u201d and took the card I was already handing out and charged me before I could even really say anything. A bowl of oatmeal is $2.50 instead of $6 so I just figured I\u2019d take advantage of the small mistake in my favor, especially cuz I eat here every day.\n\nThe next day I ordered the same omelette, went up to line,and in between the person in front of me leaving and me getting all the way to the front she had already rang me up for \u201coatmeal\u201d and was handing out her hand for my card. I have been in line when people have disputed the cashier before and nothing seems to unite strangers against you more than ruining the 5 seconds/person flow they usually have, so again, this time more afraid of the strangers then happy about a small thing going in my favor, I took the discount.\n\nNow for a third day she looked up at me, smiled, said \u201cI got you! Welcome back\u201d and pressed \u201coatmeal\u201d and charged me the $2.50.\n\nAITA for taking advantage of this for 3 days? Should I say something tomorrow? Does she know what she\u2019s doing and just likes me? Or does she really just think the oatmeal button says omelette? \n\nPeople order both pretty often so she Should have to be using both buttons.\n\nEdit: I realize my savings to date are more than $6 and are in fact closer to $3.50 x 3 = 10.50 of that sways things\n\nEdit:  so while it seems like mostly I\u2019m not the asshole (she may or may not be) I am still going to say something like \u201cjust my daily omelette\u201d tomorrow and see if she still charges me omelette or oatmeal. I\u2019ll try to get the correct price.\n\n\nThe defining arguments that made me think to do the right thing this time are the ones who said if the items were reversed and I was being over charged I\u2019d definitely complain, and I made some excuses in my OP for my behavior that means I knew it was wrong all along.\n\n\nThanks everyone for the help and the laughs. I don\u2019t mean to disappoint but I will not be using this oatmeal gift to get laid\n\nEDIT 3: Thank you all so much for your comments! Many of them say mostly the same thing but I replied to as many as I can! I can not update until I eat breakfast again so stop PMing me for updates until at least tomorrow morning haha. They don\u2019t serve omeletts or oatmeal for dinner!\n\nEDIT 4: Thank you so much for the silver! I\u2019ll update ASAP but please temper your expectations! I\u2019ve never had a post get this much attention. I will try to point out her error in a polite way ASAP! I expect the grand finale to this to either be: I pay $6/ omelette or...nothing changes. \n\nOr I meet the love of my life and propose there in line on the spot", "My husband and I live across the street from a grocery store and we're over there pretty much every day and often together. We recently moved to the area, but this is his hometown so he has a lot of friends and I haven't made any good friends yet except for his friends. He was out of town for 2 weeks because his mom was sick and while he was gone, I was spending a lot of time with a couple of his friends that I get along with because I was lonely. I went to the same grocery store twice with one of them, once to grab a coffee and once to buy some stuff for dinner with him and his wife. \n\nMy husband got back from his trip and went to the grocery store without me and a cart collector pulled him aside and told him that I was a snake and that I was stepping out on him with another guy and parading him around and that all the workers were talking about it. My husband told hi to mind his business and then told me everything. I was extremely upset by the judgement and it made me feel embarrassed to go back to the store because I will be judged every time for this misconception and apparent gossip about me. I went back to the store with my husband and got a manager and told her what the guy had told my husband. The manager told me he was going to get fired and I haven't seen him since. I feel a little bad for making the guy lose his job, but at the same time, I'm pissed at what he said about me. My husband agrees that reporting him as the right thing to do, but my parents told me I should have let it go. Was I an asshole for reporting him and getting him fired?", "So me and my coworkers did a secret santa exchange this year. I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\n\nEdit 1: So the general consensus tends to be: NTA but I done fucked up. \n\n\nEdit 2:Okay guys so I made a super quick crude drawing of what it looked like\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/hIeZN7w\n\nPlease understand the original was much cuter, I put much more time and detail into the face and cat to make them \"kawaii\" if you will. But for this I just wanted to grasp the size that I made her. \n\n\nEdit 3: Some people seem to think I put this on a ball ornaments, and others just thinking I only gave her a doodle. I made it with shrinking plastic, which is a plastic (and image) that will shrink down and become 9 times thicker. \n\nAnyone fimilar with skrinky dinks?\n\nEnds up like this\nhttp://soapdelinews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/easy-diy-christmas-tree-ornaments.jpg", "To cut a long story short my neighbor has about 4 cars, husband, wife + kids. I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she sees me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\nEdit- I\u2019d like to mention she approached me yesterday at 7pm as I arrived home from a 9 hour work shift. Immediately she spoke down to me and tried to intimidate me, I knew she was full of shit and I told her that I don\u2019t consent and if she touches my gate that it\u2019ll turn into a criminal matter and that I myself will be contacting the council to talk about it with them as I have no knowledge of what she is speaking about. It\u2019s not like she approached me with respect, it was more of a this is what\u2019s going to happen and you can\u2019t stop it. \n\nEdit 2 - UPDATE - \n\nI called the council yesterday and told them everything the person over the phone asked me if I received a letter from the council about this situation I said no, they then informed me this woman has no right to do anything and if she were telling the truth that I would have received a letter. They told me if she starts building on my property that I have to right to call the police. \n\nI don\u2019t know what is wrong with my neighbor she was waving a fake note in-front of me when this incident first happened, I am tempted to go knock on her door but I\u2019ll hold back and wait for her move. \n\nAnd her whole family is banned from parking in my drive way.

HUGE. we found a 10 hour screening that showed the first 4 movies back to back. naturally, we decided to go. the theatre was mostly empty, except for this one couple and their kid a few rows down. this kid would not stop crying for a goddamn second. i ignored them for the first hour, then made some annoyed coughs that they heard, but ignored, and finally, i went up to them and asked them if they could either calm the kid down, or leave with him. they were rather rude about it, saying they were entitled to the theatre as well, and that we should deal with it. \n\nthey were probably accustomed to the sound of a child crying, and seemed to be having a good time, but i was miserable, unable to enjoy the movies. so, i started bawling loudly as well, right until one of them shot a dirty glance at me, took the kid, and left. \n\non the way out, the wife told me that they'd been looking forward to this break from parenting for a long time, and that I'd ruined their day. girlfriend thinks i'm TA. i think, leave your kid at home with a sitter if you can't get them to shut up. AITA?\n\nEdit: Kid was an infant, probably like a year old.\n\nEdit 2: Everyone's bringing this up; theatre staff talked to the parents themselves when the movie began, but were reassured that it wouldn't be an issue. the parents simply waved them off, and they stopped bothering after, so i didn't see much sense in calling the usher again.\n\nUpdate: Met my girlfriend again today, she made a joke about the incident that ended up in the both of us laughing. she found what i did funny, but she felt bad for the parents having to leave, hence the post. we're both having an amazing time rn reading through the comments lmao\n\nmost of you think i didn't do much wrong, but next time, i'll try to sort it out more maturely :P\n\nfor the idiots saying don't go to a kids movie if you don't like kids crying, HP has a huge young adult following, plus, the kid wasn't really old enough to be watching the movie. this would apply if it was a 3 year old at an animated movie. sorry, but no.\n\nlastly, a gold on a throwaway account? goddamn, gonna have to find people to shower with coins before i delete this account :P thanks, stranger.", "I just got my first apartment after 10 years of fighting poverty (2 of it homeless).

I am the sous chef of a small farm to table restaurant about 30 miles from where I grew up. The executive chef an I have a system for reviewing applicants; I conduct the first interview, and if I think they have potential, I set up a second interview with the executive. We have worked together for years and he trusts my judgement.\n\nLast week, I had an interview with a name I immediately recognized, lets call him Jake. Jake was in my high school graduating class, and for the good part of junior and senior year he made my life hell. Now I wasn't particularly popular in high school, but I was never bullied, except by this guy. His favorite thing to do would be to loudly insult me in front of his friends, then force me to leave because I wasn't cool enough to be around his cool friends. This happened at lunch, gym, assemblies, and sporting  events. I distinctively remember one football game where he kept telling everyone how much weight I had gained recently, calling me a fat fuck and making me sit in the bleachers on the other side of the field. I still think about that stuff today to be honest.\n\nFast forward 10 years later, and he is sitting in front of me interviewing for a job. I decide to not bring this up, and he never mentions any of it. His interview actually went really well, and he had a pretty good resume. But before we even start talking, I know I am not going to hire this guy.  I finish the interview, tell him I will be in touch, and he leaves. I later call him and tell him we accepted someone else for the position. \n\nAs i was driving home I started to feel a little guilty. This guy was definitely qualified, and we don't see too many applicants being in a small town. High school was 10 years ago, I know I was a different person then, and maybe Jake has changed for the better. \n\nAm I wrong to judge someone for their actions so long ago? I definitely feel like a bit of an asshole, but honestly if I had to work with him again it would bring up a lot of memories I try not to think about anymore.", "So - I was on a 3 PM EST flight that was about three hours long from the east coast to TX.

I pay all my own bills, work full time while being full time in college so money and time is tight but I knew this was important so I went ahead and told her I would request off work and definitely be there. A week later I went out and splurged and bought bottles, pacifiers, baby shampoo Etc. as a gift to give her at the baby shower. Anyways, about a week before the baby shower I get a text from her saying this party would actually be a gender reveal party and they were having a separate baby shower 3 weeks later that she wanted me to come to as well. Okay... I was slightly annoyed because I knew I was going to have to request off work again and buy another gift. I told her I would try my best to be there but I couldn\u2019t make any promises. Two days before the now \u201cgender reveal\u201d party she texts me in a group message of people and says there\u2019s an entry fee of $20 to the party! I was seriously blown away. I understand it takes planning and money to put together a party but it was her choice to have one. I texted her privately outside the group message and told her I didn\u2019t have $20 extra to bring to the party, since I already got her a gift and had other bills to pay. She replied saying \u201cSorry girl, I can\u2019t make just an exception for you. You promised you would be there!\u201d I didn\u2019t reply, and didn\u2019t show up. She texted me a few days later informing me I was disinvited to the future baby shower and how she was appalled I couldn\u2019t even send a message to let her know I wasn\u2019t coming after I said I would be there.\nReddit, I understand maybe I should\u2019ve clarified I wasn\u2019t coming at the point. Although, she knows my situation and that I live paycheck to paycheck. I have now lost a close friend and I seriously can\u2019t decide.. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Wow! Just got back on Reddit and I feel so much better knowing I\u2019m NTA. I always let people walk all over me and I felt extremely guilty considering maybe she had got goodie bags or something for me and I didn\u2019t technically tell her I wasn\u2019t attending. I found out today through a mutual friend that only 11 people showed up out of 30 + she invited.  Unfortunately I don\u2019t have the receipt for the gifts I bought & don\u2019t know anyone else with newborn kids,  but if anyone is in need and felt comfortable giving me there address or a PO box I would love to ship to them to you!

I\u2019m so thankful, today has been a great day, thank you guys!!!!", "\\*Update below!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy cousin is getting married in August - a destination wedding out in the mountains of Colorado. My husband and I are professional filmmakers and do a lot of work together. We own our own equipment and both act as operators sometimes, or otherwise we hire additional crew and take on different roles, depending on the job.\n\nMy cousin - who I am decently close to - asked if my husband and I will video her wedding for her. This was after we received her invitation, RSVP'd yes, and after we've purchased our plane tickets / booked our hotel. She says she will pay us a 'small stipend', but she loves our work and can't find a good videographer out in this small town in Colorado.\n\nMy husband and I don't want to do it. Not only would we have to cart all of our gear out to Colorado, but that's all we'd be doing the whole wedding. My cousin is super particular, really picky, and despite her saying that it would be okay if we only captured the best moments, those 'best moments' are all over a wedding. (We also don't film weddings - we've never filmed a wedding previously. The small work we do as a 2 person crew is mostly for non-profits.) You just have to be filming the whole time. How would it ever work for us to be guests, and be paid videographers? We aren't taking time off, paying $800 each for plane tickets, and the hotel etc etc just so we can work for way below our regular rate. We wouldn't be experiencing the wedding, we'd just be working - doing our regular job for this event. Also, I don't think it would be right for me to even accept the 'small stipend' from her any way - so we'd be doing it for free.\n\nMy cousin has said that she wants us there 'first and foremost' as guests, but I know that her ideal would be for the whole wedding to be filmed. If we do get to put down our cameras though, we will have to be charging batteries, or downloading footage. It's not something, for a one night event, that you can just stop doing to enjoy yourself.\n\nI'm worried that saying no to my cousin will ultimately really hurt our relationship - but I genuinely feel she doesn't understand what a commitment this is for me and my husband to do for her, and, if I explain it all to her, I think she'll just hear me say 'no', without getting it. I'm really proud of my husband and my work together, and I know my cousin is expecting something of that caliber. It won't be of that caliber if we don't film the whole thing ... never mind watching through all the footage and editing, and probably hiring our composer to write something for the piece (what we usually do with our commercial work, and what my cousin is used to seeing from us).\n\nI feel so torn up about this. I want my cousin to be happy, and she's definitely known to fly-off-the-handle (she held a grudge with my sister for months over something petty a few years ago) ... but I don't want to work during her wedding that I'm already paying a lot of money to attend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** I emailed her saying I don't have experience with weddings and it would be a disservice to her to not hire a real wedding videographer. I offered to look up some in the area and asked for her budget / who she's spoken to already. She called me, saying that it doesn't matter that I don't have the experience, and it would mean so much to her. She said she's over budget and loves my work so much. I told her that we really want to be there and enjoy it, and she said she'd make sure we had a good time regardless ... agh.\n\nWe're thinking about skipping the wedding entirely and pretending we booked a big gig that we can't turn down or something? We don't want to start a precedent of working for family ... feel like it will become a pattern if we say yes and do it. We were able to turn down a commercial due to timing for my uncle's business (on the other side of the family) who wanted a big discount ... we can't start working for family for free now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE:** I called her this morning and told her we can\u2019t do it. It's beyond our weight limit for our carry ons / suitcases without paying extra (which is true), we have a ton of other work we're editing currently (also true), and I want to be there with my family to celebrate her, not to work (true) \u2026 and that, even if we just brought one camera and minimal gear, it wouldn't be up to the quality she wants, or the quality I'd want her to have in a wedding video (true). She was pretty upset about it but said in the end that they weren't planning on hiring a videographer anyway - and a video was something additional they could live without. She just thought it wouldn't be a big deal for me to make something for them ... but she said she was expecting us to both be filming, and for us to bring our professional gear and make it like a \"normal wedding video\".\n\nI ended the conversation by saying that we can't wait to celebrate with her, and she didn't push it any further, she was still kind of pissed. So ... \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nThank you all for your responses - really meant a lot to me. You guys are awesome :)", "About a year ago, my sister asked if she could use my Prime account for some birthday gifts. Since then, my brother, sister-in-law, and mother have obtained my account info and use it on a regular basis.\n\nIt's becoming a real problem. I constantly have unwanted items in my cart. Dozens and dozens of \"saved for later\" items. I've accidentally purchased other family member's items. I get the most random and inappropriate suggestions. Nothing is sacred, every single thing I purchase is exposed to my nosy family. And my favorite, I get text notifications for shipping, so now I know when my brother's ass cream will arrive.\n\nSo today I broke. I reset the password and immediately sent a text saying, \"My Amazon account is closed for business.\"\n\nYes I know I could've used more tact in the text, but fuck it, I want my life back.", "My husband and I have been trying to conceive since early this year. This morning he told me that, if we don't conceive by the end of this month, he wants me to get back on birth control and that we will wait to try again until December of this year. His reasoning is that it will be better if our kid is born sometime between September and December because s/he will be one of the older kids in his/her grade and this  will give him/her advantages in school and sports. I don't really care what month our kid is born and would rather keep trying than wait until December rolls around. My husband thinks I'm being selfish because I'm prioritizing my desire to have a baby over making sure that our kid has all of the advantages possible.  AITA?", "I (26F) live with my mother (52F) and sister (13F). I pay most of the bills and rent since I have a decently paying job and my mother is unemployed.\n\nLast year I started dating my girlfriend (32F). My mother is a very strict christian and doesn't approve at all (side note, my girlfriend is trans and you'd think that would cancel out because in her eyes she's a man therefore I'm in a heterosexual relationship... but logic doesn't seem to apply in christianity since I guess that just makes us double gay in her eyes) but since I pay the bills she can't really strong arm me into breaking up with her. \n\nRecently my girlfriend needed a place to stay because her apartment building was being renovated so I told my mother that I wanted her to stay with us. Predictably she completely freaked out at the idea saying that she would not be having sin under her roof. I reminded her that I'm paying most of the rent and living expenses but she refused to budge saying that it would be a bad influence for my sister (who is very comfortably straight anyway).\n\nThe conversation ended there but I wasn't just going to leave my girlfriend hanging. My mother being as controlling as she is had the lease be in her name even though I'm the one actually paying for it. So I talked with my girlfriend about the situation and we decided to just find a new place together. We also agreed that my sister could live with us for free if our mother lets us.\n\nI brought up the new plan to my mother. She did not take it well at all. Asked me what she was supposed to do. I told her that my sister is welcome to stay with us but she would have to figure something out for herself, or she could decide to stop choosing to be homophobic (she loves saying we choose to be gay) and let my girlfriend move in. She's since shut herself up in her room and isn't talking to me or my sister. I told my sister what was going on and hugged her and promised she'd always be welcome to stay with me if I end up moving out.\n\nThe current plan is: If my mother doesn't budge I suspect she will end up homeless and I will then be able to call cps to make sure my sister ends up with me. I feel really guilty that it has to go this way but I've spent my entire life putting up with her homophobia and I'm sick of it.", "Going to try to make this as short as possible while including details needed. \n\nI have been with my fianc\u00e9 for 6 years. Fianc\u00e9 has an older sister, we'll call her Sally, who is 28 and has a 5 year old child. I was there the day Sally was in labor and Baby was born, she is my niece. His entire family has referred to me as his Auntie since day 1. I am not blood but we are family, she calls me Auntie and we have sleepovers, zoo visits, etc. \n\n2 years ago Sally was in rehab from drug addiction. Alcohol, pain killers, and Xanax were her thing. She had a mental breakdown and the family collected money to send her to rehab and all organized a schedule to take care of Baby. The baby's dad, Sally's boyfriend, has a welding/construction job and was out of town for 2 months so he wasn't there for all of this. \n\nShe checked herself out after 3 days, insisting she was \"fine and just needed a safe withdraw\". I pick her up, take her to her house, and she immediately goes to smoke weed and drink a beer. I don't think weed is a drug and am very pro-cannibas although I don't smoke, but that was not appropriate considering I just picked her up from rehab. \n\nA week later she was fired for snorting in the bathroom., evicted for being 4 months late, totaled her car driving while high and is being sued for $50k from wrecking into a house, and was kicked out of Fianc\u00e9's other sister's house for forgetting the sink was plugged up and running (she was high) and the entire downstairs was RUINED from water damage because nobody else came home for 8 hours. $20,000 of damage and thank god their house insurance covered it. \n\nThat was all last year. They've been in their new house on their own for about 6 months. In November she called FIL and said their electricity was shut off because she didn't have the money because BF's paycheck got messed up and didn't go through. He paid their late electricity bills.. a total of $500. I thought it was suspiciously expensive but kept my mouth shut. All has been quiet since. \n\nTwo weeks ago, she asked me to borrow some money to get groceries for Niece. Of course I'm not going to let my niece or sister go hungry, no matter what is going on otherwise, so I say I'll be over at 5. I got off work early and get there at 2:45. I come in using my spare key, walk in, see Niece playing with dolls in the corner, Sally passed out on the couch, and heroin on the coffee table. Unfortunately coming from a family riddled with addiction, I know what heroin looks like. I don't know how much it was, but I could have scooped it up and filled my palm with it. I noticed radiators everywhere in the front room and Niece was in multiple layers of clothes and her winter jacket. The heat was off. The house was maybe 40F - it was 30 outside. \n\nI took Niece to my car, and called 911 for an ambulance as I was scared Sally was overdosing.  I didn't want to alarm and freak out Niece so I stayed in the car and let her play on my phone until the ambulance arrived. Of course police and CPS showed up as well. I explained the situation and because Niece's dad is out of town working, FIL/MIL were called. When they arrived they were quiet and cold, didn't really talk, took Niece, and told me to go home. \n\nAn hour later I get home and fianc\u00e9 asks me what I've done. I explained everything to him and all he had was anger for me. Apparently the entire family already knew and were pissed at me for what I had done. Apparently I was \"out of line and stupid\" because I called 911 before seeing if she was actually OD'ing because it turned out she was just nodding out from the heroin. We fought for hours and I left and spent the night at my best friend's house and cried all night. I couldn't handle it all so I turned my phone off and tried to relax and just calm down. My best friend was up all night with me, telling me I did nothing wrong, and I'm okay. \n\nI turn my phone on and I had 65 texts/messages. MIL, FIL, SIL, fianc\u00e9, and their extended family members blaming me. They are saying I ruined her life, ruined Niece's life, made everything more complicated than it needed to be, made it public when it was a \"family affair\", and ruined Sally's chances of ever getting cleaned or having custody of her child again, none of them ever want to see me again and I will never see my niece again, and they want me to pay for Sally's jail bond and sue me for the CPS case and emotional damages.\n\nI am also now single. So on top of losing my best friend of 10 years (fianc\u00e9), I will lose my apartment I had with him, what I considered my family, and my Niece.\n\nI truly feel horrible. I have horrible anxiety to the point where I'm worried someone is going to come get \"revenge\" on me for what I did. I can't eat. I have lost 7 pounds from it. I'm not sleeping for shit. I have bags under my eyes. I've had 8 migraine-days in two weeks. At first I felt so confident in my decision but as the days go by I'm thinking maybe they were right and I should have checked on her before calling 911 and being frazzled. I don't care about Sally anymore, but I did rip a 5 year old child away from her parents and I feel horrible about it. I know someone in the family will take her in, but it's never like being with your parents. She will grow up resenting me for it and all I've ever done is love her as my own. \n\nReddit, AITA? Please help me. The guilt is eating me alive. ", "So, I'm gay. My friend sent me a picture of the rainbow manicure she got and I said \"nice that's gay lmaooo\". I think I just forgot she, like many of my friends, didn't know I'm gay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe went off at me all \"Just because it's rainbow doesn't mean it's gay, and even if I was gay that wouldn't be a problem, gay is okay\" yada yada yada. She even posted the chat on social media *with my name and picture* (as the contact). I saw this and instantly replied \"Oh shit, I guess we never got on this topic, but I'm gay myself...maybe you should take down that post now that we've cleared up this misunderstanding\". And she just left me on read lmfao. Now all her friends think I'm some homophobe when actually *I'm* the gay one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean I get how that could seem homophobic, but posting it on social media??? That's a step too far imo. I feel like she's just trying to get woke points by posting it online, because even if I was straight calling something that's rainbow gay is not offensive. It's literally the gay flag, I mean that's pretty fuckin gay. I mean, it's not like I was even insinuating gay=bad, I was just making a joke and even if she was trying to get sjw brownie points she didn't have to use my name \\*sigh\\*.", "So my husband and I both have really BIG families. I originally wanted a child free wedding, but hubby thought there would be too many hurt feelings over it, especially since I did still want my little sister there as a flower girl. My cousin, Anne, has a 5 year old son, let's call him Ben, who has autism. I love Ben to death, he's a sweetheart, but he has a tendency to act out and throw long tantrums, so I was a little nervous about having him there. I tried to have a heart to heart about this with Anne as delicately as I could, but she immediately got offended and told me she \"knows how to control her son.\"\n\nSo it's my wedding day. I wasn't there to hear it because I hadn't walked down the aisle yet, but our officiant makes an announcement about our unplugged ceremony preference. A pretty common practice. My dad walks me down the aisle and I'm seriously overjoyed. And then I hear it. Ben has an iPad that Anne gives him to keep him occupied. He can sit in front of it for hours watching YouTube videos about trucks. She gives it to him all the time at restaurants and stores to keep him occupied. And she also gave it to him on my fucking wedding day. \n\nBen is on his iPad, watching his truck song videos at a more than audible volume and Anne is just........ letting him. It totally throws me off and I think my poor officiant saw the complete panic on my face because he stopped and did another quick \"reminder\" about our unplugged preference. Anne didn't get the hint? My husband said it was fine and told him to keep going because he doesn't like making a scene, but seriously, all I can hear is this fucking truck song and the quiet chaos going on around it. At this point, people start telling Ben to shut it off and Anne is telling them to leave him alone. My stepbrother told her to take him out, which just made Anne cry, so then I have to say my vows to the tune of Truck Tunes and my cousin crying and the uncomfortable laughter from some of our other guests.\n\nI'd definitely consider my wedding ceremony ruined, which we put a LOT of money into, and I'm still livid about it. I didn't speak to Anne at the reception, and later SHE confronted ME about how she couldn't believe I let her and Ben be humiliated like that at the ceremony. WHAT. I went off on her. Totally lost my mind and said a bunch of shit about how she lacks any shred of awareness or common decency, among other not so nice words. My mom thinks I'm overreacting and that it really \"wasn't that bad\" and \"kind of funny if you think about it\" and that the iPad debacle was way better than Ben having a meltdown in the middle of the ceremony without it. She thinks I should apologize to Anne and basically give her a pass because she's the single mother of an autistic kid, but I just don't think it's fair to play the disability card here.

We always knew I\u2019d die younger than I wanted to, but we never expected it to be this soon.\n\nAs much as I know I should tell my wife, I don\u2019t want my last year to be plagued with an impending doom.\n\nMy wife and I have always talked about living abroad somewhere, maybe Australia, but we\u2019ve never found the time or money to do so. I\u2019ve been saving up to go to graduate school, however, I don\u2019t see much point in that now.\n\nSo here\u2019s my idea: take some of that money, and take my wife to Australia for a few months, and enjoy the time together. I have a job I can work remotely from anywhere, and she has a job that she can easily find work anywhere. We can work part-time, and enjoy our time together. When we get back, or maybe towards the end of it, I will break the news to her. I just wouldn\u2019t want the trip to be ruined for us by constant reminders of me dying. I know my wife, and she\u2019s very emotional - to the point where I feel like she will be crying everyday and not enjoying herself. I want this memory to be a good one for her, and not plagued by my time ticking down.\n\nAITA for putting off telling her I am dying?\n\nNote: I have life insurance that will take care of her, so I am not too worried about spending this money now on this trip. And I plan on talking to her about a sperm bank, just in case she decides she wants my kids in the future, as well as premised birthday cards and other things for her to have.", "So next weekend my FE friend is getting a little surprise bday party thrown for him. His gf is organizing the party, it's going to be just friends and family at his mom's house and a pretty friendly atmosphere. As a joke, but not really, I want to buy him a globe as a present. So WIBTA if I did that? He's pretty adamant about it being a flat earth and he will probably launch into some diatribe about his beliefs so I think I already know the answer, but hey that's my sense of humor and I also could see it as hilarious. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: This is absolutely 100% not a troll or s/post whatsoever. I'm sorry some people have nothing better to do than to Spost or troll people, but that is not the case at all. If I didn't care about his friendship I would link to his FB so you can all see for yourself but I am not going to do that. I am friends with him because I know his whole family, I am friends with all of them from his mom to his uncles, brother, cousins and even his kids are friends with my kids. Our friendship is strong and he's not going to be butthurt and in his feelings over this he will tell me to Foff, maybe punch me in the arm and then move on. Anyways it's a small minority that think I shouldn't do it and that have no sense of humor, I am going to get him a real gift, not just the gag gift globe. And thanks for all the support and the people that still have a sense of humor in this day and age. It will be done and I will update, so click that save button or use the remind bot, party is Saturday so check back on Sunday. Peace, love and chicken grease, I'm out for now.\n\nUpdate: I didn't video the unveiling, but it was funny AF! He was a little bit irritated about it, but he took it with humor he said who the F got me this a couple times to the crowd, I couldn't keep from busting up laughing and fessing up to doing it, he was like fuck u bud, lol'ing, then I gave him some wax and a blunt as the real gift, his mom gave him shit about being FE, and we all kinda clowned on him for a few mins,he took it great, talked shit back & his one conspiracy theory cousin was on his side, they pushed back a little bit but we all just joked and laughed and got on with the party. 10/10 highly recommend it to anyone who has a FE friend who has a sense of humor.", "I'll try to make this simple. My Girlfriend (30f) and I (36m) have 100% custody of my 5 year old Daughter. My daughter's biological mother moved out of state to pursue a career opportunity. \n\nA little background - my Ex-wife left me over 2 years ago for someone else and hasnt been much of a mother since. My current girlfriend has effectively raised my daughter with me for a little over a year and has done a tremendous job as a step mother.\n\nMy Ex-wife moved just a couple of weeks ago and now my girlfriend and I have 100% custody. As a \"parting gift\", my ex made a scrap book for my daughter with pictures of my daughter, my daughter and her mother, and lastly.... my daughter, my ex and myself. There were 2 pictures total that included the 3 of us. \n\nI noticed my girlfriend tearing something apart and my daughter telling her to \"STOOOOP! SHE WORKED SO HARD ON THAT!\"\n\nNot knowing what was going on I stepped over to see what the commotion was all about. This was the first time I had seen or heard of the scrap book, and was unaware of its contents until I witnessed my girlfriend removing all of the pictures that displayed my ex-wife. She was even throwing away pictures that didnt include me and were of my daughter and her mother only.\n\nI abruptly put an end to the destruction, and have been on non-speaking terms with my girlfriend since the event. (8 hours ago) I have tried to explain that I dont want the pictures for myself, and have even stored the in the garage in a box that I keep with all of my daughters report cards and neat school projects and art. However, my GF thinks we should destroy all evidence of my ex, even though her current leave of absence is not guaranteed to be  permanent. \n\nShe was raised similarly and I asked her how she would feel if her stepmother threw away all pictures of her biological mother, just because she moved. She agreed that she would be upset, but argued that it doesnt matter now that SHE is the one raising my daughter. \n\nI'm so lost as to why she thinks this is ok. It's like jealousy and ego have gotten the beat of her and her true self has disappeared. I'm so dumbfounded by it that I'm not certain that I'm not seeing this clearly. Am I missing something?  AITA?\n\nTLDR- my girlfriend doesnt want any pictures of her stepdaughter's mother in the house (anywhere, even in storage) because she is raising my daughter, and bio mother doesnt deserved to be remembered.\n\nEdit- accidentally called GF my wife. Fixed.\nAlso- thank you all for your responses. It seemed like such a pretty thing at the time and now I feel like I just got flipped upside down.", "So for a class discussion we had to do a short presentation on something we have a strong belief in. Could be religion, politics, etc. \n\nI (16M) am an atheist and chose Pastafarianism, which is the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster \ud83d\udc7e as my religion. \n\nThe whole class was laughing except two students who were strict Muslim and Christian.\n\nMy teacher asked \"Are you just doing this as a joke or to prove some point?\" so I admitted I was. I then calmly explained why I thought religions such as Christianity and Islam were dumb, which made the two students look even angrier at me.\n\nTeacher had a word with me after me class and said don't pull that shit again. I said okay, but it's still within my free speech to say all religion, especially monotheistic ones (Islam, Judaism and Christianity) are evil. My teacher is a Christian and he looked a bit pissed so said I need to stay on focus/topic.\n\nAs it stands, I already get good grades. His class is the one I don't take seriously tbh, mostly because of the nonsense subject matter on the module and partly because he's a Christian but I calmly explained my points AITA? ", "My late mother handed me down a ring that her mother handed down to her and so on, it\u2019s been in our family for over 6 generations. Without going into too much detail, our ancestors had some pretty amazing lives and there is a lot of Masonic lore woven into my mothers side of the family. It\u2019s obviously very mysterious and fascinating but I don\u2019t and have never known much and there are NO family relics of which to speak other than this ring. \n\nMy stepdaughter is in her thirties, so we are talking adults here not children. I have been in her life for 24 years. I would say we are very close, and we do a lot together. She introduces me as her stepmother and I introduce her as my stepdaughter but we get on and are close confidants of one another. \n\nBefore my mother passed away, she asked me to do what felt right to me- whether that was giving the ring to my stepdaughter or whether that was it being buried with me when it\u2019s my time. \n\nMy stepdaughter is aware of the existence of the ring, and knows that it *could* have been destined for her one day. She has expressed an interest in keeping it but only because of its value, not the sentiment. \n\nI am leaning towards keeping it to myself, and in a poignant sort of way letting it be buried with me- I am the last person I know of carrying my mothers blood, and I like the idea the secrets will come full circle and I\u2019ll take the family secrets- literally- to the grave. \n\nI told my stepdaughter that I\u2019d like to keep it and she has shown a disappointment and said she\u2019d have liked the history to pass on to her but I\u2019m not sure how genuine that sentiment is. \n\nMy husband has the complete opposite view and thinks I ought to give the ring to my stepdaughter being as she is my child in all but name, but he ultimately supports whatever choice I\u2019ll make. I just want to know if the general consensus thinks I\u2019m the asshole for saying no.", "I (40s/M) have one son (14/M) and a step daughter (6/F). My son is playing baseball competitively this year and we spend a lot of time on the weekends training before he starts high school. He\u2019s really into it and I like helping him get better.\n\nMy stepdaughter will come into the yard while we\u2019re practicing and insist on participating. I asked her once to let us be, and my wife crucified me for it. I also let her participate once but didn\u2019t slow down my throws, hits, and running at all because I\u2019m trying to make my son better, not cater to my stepdaughter. That also upset my wife and she said it was dangerous and rude to my stepdaughter. My wife expects me to either slow down and let her play, or carve out equal time to spend playing catch with my daughter separately. I don\u2019t have the time to do that so I\u2019d have to cut back on training my son, to his detriment.\n\nMy wife accused me of favoritism and that I\u2019m intentionally excluding my stepdaughter. She claims this is different from the fact that she spends less time with my son than with my stepdaughter because she claims that\u2019s because of age difference, but still expects me to spend equal time with the kids. Am I the asshole for not wanting my stepdaughter to intrude on our practice time and not wanting to cut back the practice time?", "I will try to keep this short. My son cheated on his wife with another woman and got the other woman pregnant. After a lot of counseling and soul-searching, my son and his wife decided to remain married. They have three kids (2 girls and a boy), who are obviously my grandchildren. I am very close with them and have spoiled them since they were born. \n\nI have no relationship with the child my son had with the other woman. I believe he is almost 2 now. I think it would pain my daughter-in-law (who is like my own daughter - I have known her since she was in her young teens) if I had a real relationship with this child. She never talks about him at all. As for my son, I know he pays child support. I believe he sees the child only occasionally though. Maybe once every few months - I\u2019m not sure. \n\nAnyhow, the child\u2019s mother reached out to me. Apparently she got my number from my son. She told me who it was and basically asked if I wanted to have a relationship with my grandson. I said I wasn\u2019t sure it was a good idea and she hung up the phone. \n\nI obviously told my son about this phone call. He said he gave the woman my number but he didn\u2019t know what she was going to say. When I explained what she wanted, he had no reaction. So I dropped the subject. \n\nI\u2019m posting this on a new account because I prefer not to have my personal family business on my primary one. I am just looking for impartial judgment. Thanks.", "New to Reddit and old fogey in internet terms (32), so sorry for anything that's wrong here. \n\nI'm a bi guy in a long term relationship with a guy, and I have two kids from my prior relationship, which was with a woman. We have full custody (long story) and are doing a bloody stellar job raising them if I say so myself. \n\nAnyway, yesterday, my 8 y/o had a friend (9) over, and she asked me how come, if I'm gay, I had a girlfriend before (i.e. my kids' mum). I explained to her that I'm not gay, I'm bi, which means I like both men and women. She just responded \"oh cool I didn't know that was a thing\" and then they went back to playing. No big deal. Or so I thought. \n\nGot a phone call this morning from this kids mother and she was *furious* with me for explaining something so \"sexually explicit\" to her daughter, and stating that they don't talk to her about \"these things\" and now she's asking uncomfortable questions. I apologised and said that I didn't actually tell her anything explicit, just that some people like both men and women. The mother is still mad at me for thinking that I have a right to decide what her child is and isn't educated on (not my intention at all). I'm kinda conflicted; I don't think I did anything wrong but at the same time I feel quite guilty. AITA?", "Me(39), my wife(38)and our son(16) are sharing his laptop currently. Me and my wife had our laptop, but it\u2019s broken and it\u2019s getting fixed now. We\u2019ve been sharing it for a week.\n\nIt was late at night, me and my wife wanted to watch some movies in bed, I went to his room, knocked, he didn\u2019t answer so I went it slowly, he was asleep with laptop on bed. I took it and went back to our bedroom. I opened the laptop, he left gay porn on. Like I was dumb teen and forgot to delete browser history multiple times, but I have never just left it open. \n\nI turned it off quickly, I kinda knew he was gay already so I wasn\u2019t that shocked. My wife however was really shocked. She told me that we\u2019d have to talk to him tomorrow. I don\u2019t see what is there to talk about, he\u2019s a teen, he watches porn, he\u2019s not out to us, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to embarrass him like that and say \u201chey, we saw you were watching gay porn\u201d. I asked my wife why exactly she wanted to talk and what would we even talk about. She didn\u2019t actually answer the question, she just said that we HAVE to talk to him and she would alone if I wouldn\u2019t. \n\nSince talking to her normally didn\u2019t work, I told her not to speak about it at all or I\u2019d cancel the vacation we\u2019ve been planning for months. She got quiet and turned around. Next day she didn\u2019t talk to me normally, she called me manipulative.", "I\u2019m a server at a semi-popular restaurant in my city. I\u2019m in college and this summer I\u2019ve been interning with my states House of Representatives. I love both opportunities but something recently happened. \n\nI\u2019ve been serving at this restaurant since HS and I am now 21. I\u2019ve basically had the same schedule since I started working and so have some of the other servers. One in particular, Lindsay, has started working there this past year and I\u2019ve grown to like her. She\u2019s a single mom and all she does is work work work to give her kid anything she could ever want. She reminds me of my mom who was also a single mother but didn\u2019t have time for me or my siblings because all she did was work all the time. I wanna help her give her daughter what I wish my mom gave me. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m scheduled to come in at 3pm and I\u2019m Lindsay\u2019s relief. For the past summer I\u2019ve been coming in around 1-2 so that Lindsay can leave earlier, beat the traffic, and get her kid from daycare before they close (at 3:30). The daycare is about an hour away so this works out perfectly. I even sometimes finish serving her tables and save the tip for her anyway. \n\nEarlier in the week I had a pretty long day because I come to my serving job right after my internship. I was super tired because I also spent all night doing LSAT prep. I decided to take a nap for that hour and a half and go into work closer to 3. I get to work and Lindsay doesn\u2019t say a word to me and left. I figured she had a shitty day and I didn\u2019t want to bother her so I didn\u2019t say anything either. I kept coming in at my scheduled time for the rest of the week.\n\nYesterday I came in and I see all the other servers gathered around Lindsay who\u2019s in tears. I say hi to everyone and get the dirtiest looks. I ask what\u2019s wrong and apparently Lindsay has to find a new daycare for her kid because she\u2019s been coming in an hour late to pick her up. Of course she blames it on me being \u201clate\u201d this week. And I tell her I was sorry but I never came in late. I came in when I was supposed to and that before this week I\u2019ve been coming in extremely early so that I could help her out. But that didn\u2019t mean I owed it to her to do every time. I have things going on in my own life that I gotta deal with and I\u2019m sure if she wanted to she could\u2019ve worked out a better schedule with the managers (who\u2019re really nice) or put her kid in a daycare that\u2019s closer and more convenient. \n\nI don\u2019t think I did anything wrong but now all my co-workers are insulting me, ignoring me and refusing to cover my shifts. AITA?  \n\nTL;DR I stopped coming in early for my co-worker and because she couldn\u2019t leave early her daughter got kicked out of daycare and she blames it all on me.\n\nEDIT: wow I\u2019ve been at work and didn\u2019t this would get so much attention. I\u2019ll read everyone\u2019s comments later but as an FAQ, I did tell her either the second or third day that I wasn\u2019t going to be coming early that week but would resume after. I also called in to tell her that I wasn\u2019t going to come in and she never said anything to me after and whenever I saw her at work she ignored me. The first day I came in at my scheduled time I also tried to talk to her about it but again she ignored me and although I apologized considering I didn\u2019t let her know beforehand she didn\u2019t ask me anything or asked to talk so I figured she got it figured out. \n\nI also just found out that the managers spoke to her a while ago about getting her shift fixed and she said no because she got it covered (by me basically). So now I don\u2019t feel bad at all. The managers were willing to fix her entire schedule so she can leave earlier without it affecting how much she was taking home that day and she said no because she relied on me.  Not my problem at that point.\n\nEDIT2: Jesus fucking christ, I just got out of work and did NOT expect this to get so many upvotes or my first gold (thanks!! :)) I read every single comment and learned something from each one. If I were in her shoes I would\u2019ve appreciated it if I was given a heads up, definite fail on my part but like I said, I was fucking tired at the time, not a good excuse but that\u2019s what it was. I texted Lindsay (because she\u2019s still ignoring me) about it and apologized for the situation because I do feel really bad for her daughter.\n\n But I also told her that I wasn\u2019t going to be coming in early for her AT ALL anymore although I intended to after this week. We both fucked up but she has not came to me to discuss this at all or apologize for making our work environment very hostile for me. Now most of the other servers won\u2019t do anything for me which sucks but if they wanna be bitter about it that\u2019s their problem. And since they care so much about this I\u2019m hoping to see one of them step up to come in as early as I did (which I know won\u2019t happen because they complain when they have to work their own scheduled shifts). Lindsay and I will have a meeting with our managers tomorrow morning to sort this all out and I guess I\u2019ll update tomorrow. Thanks again!\n\nUPDATE: \n\nHey, everyone! I can\u2019t thank everyone enough for all the advice and takes on this situation. I\u2019ve gained a lot of perspective. As promised, I\u2019ve got a couple updates.\n\nI\u2019m at work right now and had a meeting with with Lindsay, my managers and the co-workers who were basically bullying me. First my managers had no sympathy for Lindsay because like I said, they came to her multiple times suggesting a schedule change and she always declined. They\u2019re going to fix her schedule in two weeks when we get our new schedule, but until then the rest of the girls (who were on her side), are gonna have to pick up those hours lol. They technically don\u2019t have have to but they know they should if they know what\u2019s good to them. They\u2019ve already complained about it and basically said it\u2019s my fault this happened blah blah blah sucks for them idc. \n\nRight after the meeting Lindsay pulled me aside and wanted to talk to me and she apologized about everything and said she didn\u2019t think everyone else would react so badly. She also said that she actually got her whole thing sorted with her kid and the daycare TWO months ago and that she\u2019s just been needing a break before she actually got her daughter. I understand her needing a break and would\u2019ve gladly done the same if she had just been honest. I feel used. I asked her why she lied about this to everyone else resulting in me being the bitch of the workplace and she cried saying she didn\u2019t think people would be so upset at me (???). I asked her to tell everyone else the truth and she said I should just keep what she told me between the two us because it will look bad on me considering no one will believe me. She\u2019s right. I\u2019ll probably tell everyone anyway. I cannot believe this at all and don\u2019t feel bad about any of this. I\u2019m not sure if her daughter actually got kicked out of her daycare but if she didn\u2019t I\u2019m also pissed that she used her daughter to lie.", "Of course if it were as simple as the subject line the answer would be yes, but there's context.\n\nMy boyfriend and I live together. A few years ago, I moved here from out of state and met him. We moved in together about a year later and have been together 3 years.\n\nSince I moved, I haven't made many friends. I'm out of college and work from home, so it's hard to meet new people. Every year around my birthday, I get really depressed now because back home I used to have huge parties to celebrate every year, but now I know like 4 people other than my boyfriend, and not super well. \n\nThis year I decided to try to have fun anyway. I talked to my BF and set up a facebook event, made plans to go to a restaurant I like here, and invited everyone I know in town.\n\nEveryone declined my invite. It was crushing. I was devastated and it really made me feel like I had no friends here at all. I wound up canceling the event and cried almost every day for the next two weeks, often sobbing on my boyfriend's shirt over it. I felt totally rejected, and every time he'd just try to soothe me by telling me how much he cares and that we'd do something \"just the two of us\" instead.\n\nOn my birthday, we went out to dinner together. I ruined my makeup, crying at dinner over the situation despite trying not to. It was painful.\n\nWhen we got home, we opened the door to find my friends waiting, yelling surprise! The reason they all canceled on my event? My boyfriend had told them to, so he could do this instead.\n\nThe party was fun and all, but I feel betrayed by my boyfriend. He thinks I'm crazy and that the positive of the party I got should override any pain that I went through before it. I think he watched me sob my eyes out for two weeks over a problem he created, knowing the whole time he could tell me the truth and fix everything - and instead had me thinking everyone I know here hates me.  \n\nWho's the asshole here?", "I'm 28M, my late wife passed two years ago. She had a son (5M now) from a prior relationship but my wife and I had a daughter as well (nearly 2F now). She passed during childbirth. My stepson is low functioning ASD and has other health disorders related to the heart and lungs. My wife was a SAHM ever since I met her.\n\nI thought I was equipped to manage both children but I learned very quickly how hard my wife had it before I came into the picture. Precisely zero daycares near me will accept my stepson because of his conditions. \n\nHe has a ventral septal defect which he has episodes over frequently: his skin will turn blue, he becomes disoriented, and if he's not restrained in a way to make him kneel down, it's a trip to the hospital. He's unable to do this on his own and physically resists. Just this year alone I've had eight hospital visits for this. This is the big one but other challenges exist, too.\n\nI had to quit my dream job to care for him because he's been turned away from every daycare. I had to go on government assistance which was difficult because I was making decent money beforehand. Difficult not only in lifestyle change but also in just getting approved.\n\nAfter two years of this, my life is going nowhere. I can't get a girlfriend, I can't get a job, I have pretty much no support here. My wife had no family, I have family who has shunned me for dating a single mother to begin with. The only one who gives me some reprieve is my mother who will babysit one day a week for me. I feel like my daughter suffers because we can't do anything: she's at the age when we'd be going to parks yet she can't even speak yet. My focus is almost entirely on my stepson.\n\nI want to give him up for adoption because I don't know if I'm equipped to do this anymore. More importantly, I want a life myself, too. I don't want to frame him as a problem because he's innocent in this, but if he was with another family, I might be accepted into my family again. I might be able to form new relationships. I'll be able to work, spend more time with my daughter, let her flourish.\n\nBut I'd be failing my stepson, my late wife's son. A little part of me thinks my wife would look down on me if I did this, yet I don't know what else to do. He belongs in the care of medical professionals, not me.\n\nWIBTA?", "My wife and I have twin daughters who are about to hit puberty. \n\nI don't know much about female puberty stuff because I come from a sexually repressed culture. I don't think they are gross or anything like that but I definitely don't want to discuss about my daughter's periods. \n\nMy wife keeps bringing up this issue with me. I'm really grossed out because they are my daughters. When I told her not to talk to me about that stuff anymore, she got upset with me and asked me what I would do if anything happened to her. I told her that I'd ask my sister for help. Well, she started crying and called me an asshole after that. AITA here?\n\nEdit: God I understand that I was wrong and I will make necessary amends. But this has become a discussion about something entirely different. I don't even understand why people think I'm going to shame my daughters or deny them sanitary products or mock them. And I'm not a child rapist or pedophile so stop messaging me. I don't want to get banned for deleting this but I'm logging off. I will try to do better but I'm not mocking or raping my children. Some people are too violent here.", "I met my husband about 10 months ago at grief counseling. I was there because of a late term miscarriage and he was grieving his wife who had just passed away in a car wreck. (Sorry if this is too heavy for some people, by the way. We\u2019re both doing super well now).\n\nI was obviously very sympathetic to the situation and never expected us to become more than friends. But we ended up connecting and got married within months of knowing each other, which I don\u2019t regret at all. I also now have a 6-year-old stepdaughter who\u2019s been incredibly sweet to me, given the circumstances.  \n\nWhen we first got engaged I sold my condo and moved into my husband\u2019s house to live with him and my stepdaughter. It\u2019s a gorgeous, spacious home and I love it. \n\nThe problem is that my husband still is keeping the master bedroom exactly as it was when his wife was alive. All of her clothes, jewelry, makeup, etc. \u2014just like it was the day she died. This is what my stepdaughter tells me. I\u2019ve never actually been in the room because my husband generally keeps it locked and has made it somewhat obvious he doesn\u2019t want me to go in there. \n\nSo we currently sleep in one of the guest bedrooms. It\u2019s comfortable enough but I\u2019m starting to get tired of this situation. At first I was tolerant. I know our relationship moved quickly and everyone had to make some adjustments. But it\u2019s now been almost a year and he\u2019s still done nothing. \n\nI got so angry yesterday that I called the room a shrine (which he didn\u2019t like at all) and said I might leave if he didn\u2019t finally box up her things. I didn\u2019t actually intend to follow through with that. I was just upset and hurt and wanted him to understand how important this is to me. \n\nWhenever I bring this up he rationalizes and says he\u2019s keeping the room that way for his daughter. But I honestly think it\u2019s for him. I\u2019m sure my stepdaughter loved her mother very much but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be particularly traumatized if the house no longer looks exactly like it did before. Besides, she is only allowed in the room when he decides to unlock it for her, which isn\u2019t all that often. \n\nHe also said he doesn\u2019t see what difference it makes to me because the guest room is basically a second master. But that really isn\u2019t the point! \n\nI mean, am I being too insensitive? Demanding?  I have pretty thick skin so feel free to give me the cold, honest truth if you wish. ", "Ive had my dogs since before we were together. We got together in HS and now decided to live together as we attend uni in the same state.\n\nI chose to take my dogs with me because they were always MY dogs, i took care of them, fed them, trained them. Moreover, they ***feel*** mine. They love me more than anyone in my family, follow me even to the bathroom. They are super well behaved but also I have to admit they are very possessive of me, wanting to hug all the time (as in lay against me while they sleep) 2 of them are super small, one is medium sized, all mutts.\n\nMy bf wasnt excited to live with them but he wasnt against it either.\n\nBut now he is, 4 months into our living together he told me an ultimatum - either I send the dogs to my parents/shelter/new owner or he leaves. \n\nAs arguments he presented that they have to sleep in our bedroom ( they do, but they don't sleep on the bed, they have their own small dog beds) so he cant focus while having sex, they are always near me, that they lick me and I kiss their foreheads - both of which he finds disgusting - and that out flat is too small anyway to have 3 dogs in it. When i said he had no problem before we moved in, he claimed he thought i will come to my senses already and \"besides, you wouldnt move in if I told you to leave your dogs and I love you too much to live away from you\"\n\nI was heartbroken but when he said he will leave if I dont get rid of the dogs, I packed my stuff and moved to my friend's flat. She was looking for a roommate anyway (thankfully) and accepted the dogs. \n\nI thought we were over, cried my heart out for a week and now after 2 weeks he called me and said he \"made a mistake\" but that he was hurt I loved dogs more than him. My whole family is on his side. Even my friend said I overreacted and that they would be mad too if \"i broke up with them over a dog\".\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: spelling\n\nEdit 2: i do try to answer everyone but some misunderstandings are so popular and the word count wont let me answer them all here so if you have to \"guess\" or \"assume\" a part of the fight, could you either ask for info or scroll down the comments? Some assumptions have been corrected by me multiple times and this is getting way more popular than I predicted so soon i wont be able to read it all even. Thank you for every single comment though, you really to help me get my head around it by giving 3rd person perspective\n\nEDIT 3: I DO NOT KISS DOGS WHILE HAVING SEX. IT WAS A GENERALISATION OF ME SOMETIMES KISSING MY DOG'S FOREHEAD OUTSIDE THE SEXY TIME. I AM NOT INTO BESTIALITY, I AM JUST A SHITTY WRITER.\n\nLast edit promise: im sorry if i dont respond to a DM but i got too damn many and some are just... so hostile so i decided to just not check it anymore after blocking yet another person (i get it you think ITA, just write it here instead of calling me an idiot)", "My daughter (17) has an unfortunate history of stealing money from her family.  As far as I know she hasn't done this to anyone outside of our home.  It has escalated over the years, despite punishments being handed out (taking away car and phone privileges).  She has taken cash that's been left on the kitchen counters or my desk.  She once swiped her younger sibling's Christmas present, a target gift card, and emptied it.  She took the money that another sibling earned for a school fundraiser and had set aside in a separate envelope.  Essentially we've learned not to leave cash out in the open.  Every time she's accused of taking money, she initially denies it but then eventually owns up, apologizes for her behavior, and pays it back.  We don't really know why she's taking money that doesn't belong to her.  She has a part-time job and all of her school and extracurricular expenses are paid for.  I am 99.9% certain it's not anything drug-related.\n\nToday while going through our main bank account, my wife discovered that she had somehow written three checks ($200, $300, $300) to our daughter over this past month and that she had deposited them to her own checking account.  When she examined the transactions, she found out that our daughter had taken the last three checks from the checkbook, wrote the amounts to herself, and signed my wife's name to them.  I don't know why she thought we wouldn't find out.\n\nHer phone and car are gone, for sure.  Her social life is over.  On top of that, I just don't feel like doing anything to help her with college applications.  She has pretty much burned away any desire or motivation to help her out.  No money for ACT and AP testing and test prep.  Nothing for college application fees.  We had plans to visit some of the schools that she was interested in.  Not gonna happen.  She has been taking voice lessons and acting classes to prepare for auditions (she's planning on majoring in voice performance or theater).  I don't feel like paying for it anymore.  My wife is concerned that she won't earn enough from her part-time job to pay for everything she'll need for a competitive audition portfolio and application fees, and that we would be sabotaging her chances for getting into the college of her dreams.  She feels that it's only my anger talking and that the usual punishments are enough.  I, on the other hand, feel extremely disrespected.  My daughter has not wanted for anything in her life.  For her to steal from us by committing check fraud is the last straw.  At this point I'm not even sure about paying for her college tuition.  Honestly, if she were 18, I'd be asking her to leave.\n\nSo, AITA for not supporting our daughter through her last year of high school?  \n\nETA: So we finally had a discussion.  She spent the money on stupid shit: clothes, going out with friends, personal items.  I checked her bank account and that seems to pan out.  It doesn't seem to be a drug problem because she recently applied for another job that required a drug test and she didn't fail (wife overheard her side of the conversation about coming in for training).  My wife is also going to contact therapists on Monday.  My daughter started crying upon hearing that.  Doesn't seem like she wants to go, maybe she's finally embarrassed about her behavior, I don't know.", "I'm going to try to explain this as clearly as possible. \n\nI have an adult friend with autism. We will call him \"John\" He lives on his own, has a job, and you wouldn't know anything is amiss until he opens his mouth and shows his complete and utter lack of understanding of social norms. You can imagine this doesn't make him very popular. He's a good man, just definitely autistic. \n\nWe have a mutual friend. We'll call her \"Sarah\". Sarah was dating John's friend (We'll call him \"Asshole\") when he raped her. I'll skip the details but this has had a major impact on Sarah's life, as well as her entire family. This was several years ago. Asshole is in jail now. \n\nA few weeks ago I was talking to Sarah and said something about John. She became very angry because a few weeks ago he implied that she wasn't actually raped. I'm sure whatever he said came across that way (Like I said he's not a good talker), but I didn't think he meant it like that. Well last week I asked John about it and yup that's exactly what he meant. \n\nApparently, Asshole told John that Sarah was making it up because he wanted to dump her, or some nonsense like that. From the sound of it John still had contact with Asshole. We talked about this for at least an hour and he finally realized that Asshole was lying to him. He didn't take it well and we haven't spoke much since. \n\nI don't know what I accomplished. Sarah (understandably) isn't interested in being friends with John anymore. And Asshole is in jail so it's not like anything changed there. I feel like I hurt John for no reason, and he would have been happier to be ignorant. \n\nEDIT: Wow I logged out for a few days. Didn't expect this to blow up. I feel a lot better guys thank you. ", "this is more of a group AITA. \nme my siblings some cousins and friends. \n\n\nso last week my cousin died, he was a beer drinking surfing beach man who hated normal things. he always made it clear that he hated funerals and never wanted one for himself. \n\nafter he died my family started planning his funeral much to the dismay of me and the others. we made it clear how much he would hate this and that going to a beach and spreading his ashes would be a better send off. the family refused and so me, my 2 younger siblings, all of my cousins friends and 5 of my cousins all went to the beach instead of the funeral, we drank beer and surfed in his honor. \n\nthe family are pissed and have been telling us how shit we are and that we ruined his special day. \n\nare we assholes. \n\nhopefully this makes sense", "My older sister is going through a messy divorce and she's pregnant. I am graduating college in April and my friends and I are planning to travel from May - August to Europe, East Asia and SEA. We've been making plans for months and discussed the itinerary many times. My sister wants me to cancel the vacation and come stay with her to help with her infant. She's giving birth in April. I told her that I don't want to miss out on this opportunity to travel. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I do not think I will get the chance to travel for an extended period of time with my friends ever again. Unless we're all retired 60 year olds. She called me selfish. But she had the chance to travel after university with her friends too. I think she's being unfair in trying to deny me this opportunity that she had.\n\n\nBoth our parents are coming over to help her during the first few months. The father of the child is also committed to helping financially. She argued that both our parents are elderly and would not be of much help. But I don't feel like that's my problem to solve. I've been looking at some affordable domestic workers/hired help to do the household chores so that she can focus on the baby but she shot that suggestion down because she doesn't want to pay extra for outside help. She would rather make me miserable for free. I arranged the baby shower that she complained was too small. I know she's family. It's duty. I don't want my future nephew to suffer. Etc. But I do want to go on this full vacation.\n\nSo AITA for choosing to go on a vacation instead of staying behind to help her with her infant? ", "I  (25f) work in a big boxed retail store and have for about 5 years now, our company does have a dress code, but not one that has ever been heavily pushed by our HR or Management in regards to some atire ( logos on shirts, athletic pants etc) \n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I was pulled into the office by my direct manager in regards of my choice of pants (I usualy wear either Jeans or Yoga pants, depending on the ammount of physical work I'll be doing that day) and was told by him that it was no longer acceptable for me to be wearing yoga pants. \n\nNow, seeing as how we recently had a change up in management, I just assumed that they were finally pushing dress code policy, and letting people know individualy, I was totaly fine with it, apologized and said it  wouldn't happen again, and moved on with my day.\n\nAfter a week had gone by, I mentioned it to one of my friends who was wearing yoga pants that day (as well as other girls/ guys wearing athletic gear)  and she said no one had mentioned anything to her, and that she hadn't heard anything about it from anyone else. Confused, I casually mentioned it to a few other people, and all of them confirmed that nothing had been said to them.\n\nAnnoyed , I went to our HR manager and asked her about the whole thing,  she flat out told me the new rule was just for me. She said there had been complaints from female customers about my wearing yoga pants (That it was unprofessional) , as well as comments from both female associates (saying I wore them for attention) and males (disgusting and derogative comments about my ass) and that they decided to enforce dresscode on me to protect myself, and how customers saw our business. \n\nDisgusted and horribly embarrassed, I told her that  singling me out would not make the situation better, and that as it is a company policy , it should apply to everyone. She told me she discussed that with management, but because they have allowed it for so long, staff would push back, and that it is not a hill they want to die on. \n\nMy next shift at work, I showed up again in yoga pants, and was pulled in again by management. They reminded me about our conversation from the previous week, and threatened to send me home. I told them about the conversation I had with HR, and refused to change my choice of clothing  until it was mandatory store wide. They told me this was only about me and not to concern myself with anyone else, I disagreed, said what they were doing was highly sexist, and that if they continued to enfore that rule on just me, I would take it to our area HR manager. \n\nA few days ago, we received a store wide communication stating that as a store, they would now be enforcing the dresscode, and anyone not follwing would be sent home, without pay. Now, due to me mentioning it earlier to some of the staff, everyone picked up on it being me behind the email, and I've now been labled a huge bitch by the store, with some of my friends calling me selfish by ruining it for everyone.\n\nEdit- sorry guys, I have responded in one of my other comments due to not having enough room on this one, I'm just new to Reddit, and don't know if there is a way to attach it or bring it to the top", "Bit of background:\nI normally work from home, but I had to come into the office for a few days, because I am applying for a new position and I wanted to shake hands and do an interview in person. It is about a 3.5 hour drive to the main office building, so my wife, our 2 kids, and I all planned to stay at a relatives house during this time. The relative\u2019s house was empty(they were going to be on vacation during this time).\n\nWe drove over yesterday, but when we were about 45 min away from their house, they texted and said their vacation didn\u2019t happen because their flights were cancelled by a hurricane. They forgot to let us know until just then. My wife had no intention of staying there while they were there too, so we was very upset by this and pleaded with me to find a hotel instead. We had no money for that, so I said we couldn\u2019t do it. We sat there arguing for a long time, she was crying for most of it saying things like \u201cI don\u2019t want to go!\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t make me go!\u201d.\n\nMy only option was to drive her back home, but that would have added 5 hours to my night and it was already late, so I told her she had to suck it up and stay there anyways.\n\nShe continued crying and punching the roof of the car, and eventually I snapped and yelled at her, saying things like \u201cStop acting like a baby\u201d and \u201cJust suck it up and deal with it\u201d.\n\nFeeling bad about the whole thing this morning, just looking for a 3rd party perspective.\n\nEdit: \nWow, this blew up. Just to clarify, the reason she didn't want to go is because she doesn't want to deal with people and try and keep kids behaving by herself. Normally I work from home so I can help her, but in this situation she has no help and she feels overwhelmed. That is the reason she told me. I, like I said, think that's a crappy reason, and I kinda wanted her to suck it up.\nThere is of course more to the fight and more was said, but typing it all out seemed like a hassle. I just included the worse parts for context.\n\nToday, she says that she is sorry and that she feels like she acted badly. Ironically, the relatives ended up changing plans again, so they are out of the house anyways.\n\nMy wife has had issues with emotions/anxiety, and yesterday was an example of the worst of it.", "So my girlfriend and I have been together around six months now. We were sitting on my couch talking when she brings up poop. I'm just gonna beat you to it, yes, this is a literal shitpost so warning. But anyways, I don't know what brought us to this topic but it makes me uncomfortable. I'm not one of those people who get grossed out by girls pooping, I just find it gross in general, like I do with blood. It's that kind of stuff that puts a disgusting image in my head and I don't like it. So I ask her to change the subject. She notices how uncomfortable I am as she teases me about and tries to make it as gross as possible.\n\nI excuse myself to go make some snacks as I don't wanna hear about her and her pooping habits. It was at this time she also got up to go use the bathroom. As I'm making some food in the kitchen, I hear bloody murder coming from the bathroom and \"SPIDER\". I grab my napkin and run to the bathroom and my girlfriend pointing to the toilet. She says its under the lid, I open it and it's just her shit. It smelt fucking AWFUL. I dropped the napkin and covered my mouth. It honestly felt like I was gonna throw up as saliva started to foam in my mouth. I dry heaved for a couple of minutes. I don't know why my body reacted this badly to that stuff, but it just does. She was laughing her ass off so I told her to get the fuck out.\n\nShe was confused and said I was over-reacting. I told her she didn't respect my boundaries after clearly telling them to her and that it's best she just leave for tonight. She told me to take a damn joke and that she was gonna go have fun elsewhere. After an hour of thinking, I'm starting to feel I blew this a bit out of proportion. So, AITA?", "To make a long story short, a club at my university was doing this \"blind date\" program where you enter preferences via their website and they have a \"matchmaking team\" that finds the best potential date. It's in their beta phase so normally it would cost something but they want feedback, so they actually offer gift cards for doing it. My friends did it and got the gift cards and I figured hey, whatever. I'll go have dinner with someone for basically free (when you factor in the gift card).\n\nI entered my preferences and the key thing to note is that I put down I'm into fitness and healthy lifestyles.....you cant put what you dont like, you just put what you like. I basically let them know I was looking for someone that enjoyed living healthy like I do.\n\nSo basically, I submitted my form and they told me what restuarant I would be going to, and we both confirmed, and we showed up at the designated time. I show up to the restaurant a few minutes early and I see an obese woman sitting at the table.\n\nMy heart sunk. I was completely and utterly disgusted. I'm not talking \"thicc\" or a tad overweight, or out of shape. No, this woman had an eating disorder.\n\nI immediately walked out of the restaurant and sent a text to her saying last minute, I couldnt go to the restaurant. I didnt tell her why or follow up with anything else. She never responded. I felt horrible. I didnt turn my survey in and I didnt collect my $20 gift card. When they asked me why I didnt want to do the feedback and get my gift card, I simply told the dude \"you guys set me up with an obese woman\" and I walked out.

Each time I pick up, I'd tell her that she got the wrong number. She'd apologise and then hang up. I've tried asking what number she dialed but she would ignore the question and hang up. Usually by the third wrong number call I would block the caller, but I couldn't block this particular number because it shows up as \"Private Number\". I can't block all unknown numbers either because I sometimes get work-related calls from unknown numbers. \n\nBy the tenth time or so, I was really annoyed that this lady kept calling the same number despite being told multiple times that she was wrong. I picked up her call, and when she asked for \"Ah Ho\" yet again, I blasted the most obscene and vulgar rap song I had on hand at the mic. She never called again. \n\nMy sister thinks I was an asshole for trolling an elderly person, but I think this was an effective way to stop the nuisance calls. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I didn't expect this post to get so many comments. After reading the response from y'all, I think what I did was definitely dickish, but I honestly don't see any better suggestions - maybe a milder song choice instead of 2 Live Crew's Pop that Pussy. \n\n1) \"Ho\" is a common family name in my country. The lady was looking for someone with that family name. \n\n2) Her English was fine. I was also able to speak her dialect so no language barriers here. \n\n3) I tried asking more questions to help her (e.g. what number she dialed, full name of the person she's looking for, why she was looking for a Ho in a place where there isn't one) but she would just apologise and hang up when she realised she wasn't talking to \"Ah Ho\"\n\nI am usually respectful to the elderly (Asian here) but this lady wouldn't respond to my attempts to help and I was really fed up.

I didn't say anything and just congratulated her on her engagement. Honestly I was surprised her fiance proposed to her with a $100 ring, but maybe it had a special meaning for them and I know the fact that her future husband gave it to her makes it priceless for her.\n\nLast Friday I wore an outfit that I thought would look well with my Timeless Elegance ring, so I decided to wear it on the middle finger of my right hand. I knew that Emily would be wearing her engagement ring, but I thought, she knows that her ring is sold across hundreds of stores and has been purchased by probably thousands of people, so if she has no problem with wearing a ring like that, then I don't think she would have a problem with seeing someone wearing the same ring. \n\nUnfortunately she did. When she saw that I was wearing the same ring she pulled me aside and asked what the hell I was thinking wearing the same ring, was I trying to make her feel that her engagement ring is just an accessory?\n\nI told her I'm not trying to make her feel anything by wearing my ring that I bought way before she had hers, and I that I'm sure her ring is priceless because her fiance gave it to her, but I think that she's not in a position to tell me that I can't wear something I own just because she owns something similar.\n\nShe had some choice words for me and has not talked to me since.

I am hiring an attorney to guide me through the child support process.\n\nHe is insistent that I have a termination because   he is not interested in supporting a child for 18 years. Out of no where, his wife contacts me this morning, very angry, threatening legal action if I didn\u2019t terminate. I get that she is upset with her husband, but I have no f-cking clue why she called me with threats and name calling. I don\u2019t even know how she found my number! I\u2019m really upset right now but I feel like I have done nothing wrong with my decision to keep the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because I get that she\u2019s upset. But I definitely don\u2019t think I am either!", "Long story short, my best friend got married last year. I was asked to be co best man and had to share duties with one of his former coworkers because said coworker had asked my best friend to be his best man a few years beforehand. \n\nMy best friend and I had been friends years before this coworker came into the picture but I was fine with sharing duties. Coworker lives across the country now so I was tasked with planning the bachelor party and paid for everything. Coworker never attempted to help with planning or financially.\n\nBest friends wedding comes around and I\u2019m relegated to 2nd best man. I have to give my speech after \u201ccoworker\u201d and even though I was told I\u2019d be the one to do it, coworker signed best friends marriage certificate.\n\nI\u2019m getting married next year and my fianc\u00e9 brought about the idea of not doing a wedding party (groomsmen and bridesmaids) as to not make people feel like they had an obligation so they could just enjoy the wedding. I agreed but only to spite my friend and not have him be my best man. If the events that played out hadn\u2019t happened, I would have fought to have him be my best man. I\u2019m also planning on having another friend sign my marriage certificate. Am I being an asshole?", "This past Halloween my family was going to go trick-or-treating so I offered to stay behind and give out candy. My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?", "I have a daughter, Emma, who is 6 going on 7, going into second grade in the Fall. I'm her mom, so of course I think she's beautiful, but realistically she is exceptionally very pretty and it's the thing everyone comments on about her, which bothers me AND her. People also always tie that to her 'breaking boys' hearts' or teasing her about boyfriends or marrying boys. She's not even 7 years old yet, but people have been saying this type of stuff since she was a baby.\n\nEmma has never liked this, and since kindergarten if someone says she's pretty she'll say, 'I'm kind and smart too' or 'I am a good helper and like to share too.' She also gets upset and draws inward when people tease her about breaking boys' hearts or having a boyfriend. Since she was maybe two years old she has always talked about marrying girls and thinking boys are icky, take that as you will; we are. We don't expect a little child to have her sexuality figured out but we also don't want to make a big deal about it or 'correct' her in case she does end up wanting to marry a woman.\n\nSo long story short, after Easter, I sent an e-mail out to our family and close friends asking them if they could ease up on talking about her appearance and teasing her about boys after she cried that night because her Grandma said she'd have to marry a boy and she didn't want to. You'd think I asked my family to cut off limbs or eat a pile of dog doo based on the response and things have been tense since, with lots of passive aggressive comments about how I 'won't let them say ANYTHING' and how what they're saying is 'normal.' Her paternal grandparents responded that they are going to 'just skip' her birthday party in case they 'offend' me.\n\nMy husband (and my brother and his sister) are the only ones who don't think I'm being an asshole here, but now my extended family makes me think I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but these comments really do upset Emma a lot, so I don't know what to do here.\n\nEDIT: Since a bunch of people have asked, this is the e-mail sent to our families:\n\n\"Just a head's up, we're trying something new. Emma has told us that it upsets her when people compliment on her appearance or tease her about boys, so we'd all appreciate it if no one made comments like that to her. You know she rarely fusses, so if she says something bothers her, we want to try to take it seriously, and appreciate your help.\"\n\nThere's a handful of people claiming this is fake because kids don't talk like this; I see you have never met a Montessori kid!", "My girlfriend and I had been together for 2 and a half years.  Before my decision to break up we had bought a vacation package together for her sisters wedding in Maui.  She was short on splitting the cost so I covered $1,700 of the $2,500 total cost.\n\nAfter the breakup she would not allow me to go with her because it was my choice to end the relationship and she would not be paying me back for any part of the trip.  I insisted that I should still be able to go because of the amount I paid towards the trip.  \n\nAll I wanted to do was go to Hawaii sleep on the couch of the hotel we had in the evening and be gone the rest of the day.  She made the argument I would be ruining her sisters wedding, which none of her family was staying at the same hotel we had booked and had no plans to hang out or be a part of any part of the wedding.\n\nShe then canceled my ticket without telling me and I will never see any of the $1,700 back or the money she got back for my plane ticket.\n\nEdit:  I want to make it very clear I wanted little to no interaction with her the whole trip.

I\u2019m not trying to be the evil stepmother or anything, but I feel like she\u2019ll just try and ruin the day, I was thinking of saying to my fianc\u00e9 that we should make it an adult only wedding. \n\nDo you think he will find this offensive though? Any father\u2019s or mothers here how would you feel about this? \n\nWibta if I suggested this?\n\nEdit...because a lot of you seem to be jumping to conclusions - his daughter isn\u2019t with us most the time, she lives with her mother, and I actually often go out when she\u2019s here because I can\u2019t deal with her attitude towards me. I feel like if she came to the wedding she would actively try and ruin it, and I feel like I should be able to enjoy my wedding day, of course if my fianc\u00e9 says he wants her there there\u2019s nothing I can do, but am I really the asshole for just suggesting it to him and getting his opinion?", "When my son was born, he had a dark skin complexion.

Now originally I thought, this is common in babies at birth and maybe as he got older maybe something to do with the pigmentation (right term?) would change and his skin colour would look more like ours. That never happened.\n\nNow for some context I feel is necessary, early on in our marriage there were some trust and fidelity issues when I caught her pretty much on the brink of an emotional affair with her co worker. We stayed together and reconciled, it wasn't easy but I was glad we did and she was very remorseful about how far she had let things go. The problem is, the other guy had the same complexion that my son does.

They were 16 and I understood their point of view. I tried to communicate with them, wrote them letters, tried to explain for years. But they decided to cut me out of their lives. I attempted to contact them after they were a little older and my attempts were met with a  \"Stop trying to talk with me creep\".

When I got in the Uber, the driver (who I must stress was VERY friendly and personable) asked if it would be okay if he picked up another passenger on the way to my destination, \u201cto kill two birds with one stone\u201d. I tentatively obliged because I felt awkward, and I assumed he had the option to change the pricing from regular to pool in order to pick the other passenger up. Instead, he pulled up Lyft, and picked up two other passengers. They were also not told they would be sharing the ride, as they were both visibly surprised and had to have the situation explained to them. \nFrom there, the experience was fine. We were going the same way, the other passengers were no issue, and the driver truly was pleasant and attempted to make conversation amongst us. \nHowever, I checked, and I was still charged the full amount, as if I had ridden solo. The difference is almost $6, which isn\u2019t a ton of money but it\u2019s the principle more than anything. \nI am strongly considering reporting him, but am feeling super guilty. I know a lot of people who use Uber driving to work their asses off and who really need the money, the guy is just trying to make a living.

My mom herself liked the idea of the middle name very much and insisted we keep it as she doenst want to deprive my boyfriend from that choice.

However, I am originally from New York.\n\nMy first day at work, I met the two women who I would be sharing an office with. One woman, Madison is only 2 years older than me.\n\nWhen I first met them both, they seemed very friendly, and asked a bunch of questions. I told them I was from New York and Madison said \u201coh we\u2019re not going to get along. I hate people from the North.\u201d I thought she was joking so I sort of laughed it off. \n\nWell, it turns out she wasn\u2019t kidding. Over the last two months or so that I\u2019ve worked there, Madison has complained about \u201cyankees\u201d a lot. Her most common complaints are:\n- northerners are too \u201csensitive\u201d (politics)\n- northerners don\u2019t respect God enough\n- northerners have no \u201csouthern hospitality\u201d\n- northerners don\u2019t have family values\n- northerners have no morals\n\n(She has made all these assumptions from one trip she took to NYC in 6th grade because a homeless man called her mother a bitch for ignoring his request for money.) \n\nMadison is particularly critical of my boyfriend (who she has never even met before). Ever since finding out he was both from New Jersey and black, she has made many insensitive and rude assumptions about him.\n\nShe has accused my boyfriend of being abusive, rude, ugly, \u201cghetto\u201d, selfish, and many other negative things without ever actually meeting him. And, she always goes on and on about how her \u201ccountry boy\u201d is God\u2019s gift to earth. She constantly tells me that I need to find a religious southern man like she has. \n\nSo, all in all, Madison is the worst and I try to keep my distance from her by any means possible. \n\nToday, I was in meetings all morning. When I came back, Madison was crying and the other lady was comforting her. As soon as I walked in Madison told me through heavy sobbing that a girl had instagram DMed her to tell her that her boyfriend had been cheating withher for the past YEAR. The girl only told her because he had just recently \u201ccheated\u201d on her with ANOTHER GIRL and she found out. \n\nAfter Madison told me all this I said \u201chm.. looks like dating a \u201ccountry boy\u201d doesn\u2019t work out for everyone\u201d and then I went to my lunch break. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t really feel bad about it cause I didn\u2019t think what I said was that rude,but the other lady from our office said that I was out of line with that comment. She doesn\u2019t like Madison either, but she thinks I took it too far. So, now I\u2019m torn. \n\nAITA for \u201cmocking\u201d my coworker after her boyfriend of three years cheated on her?", "Mine and my sister\u2019s families are very close. Our kids are more like siblings than cousins. My eldest niece got engaged, and we were all thrilled for her. My daughter and I spent hours on the phone with her helping her with early wedding planning. My niece even mentioned to my daughter that she was having a hard time finding enough bridesmaids because many of her friends are pregnant.\n\nThen we all stared finding out who my niece had chosen to be in the wedding party. Everyone in the family was included except for my daughter. My niece asked me and her two sisters to be bridesmaids, asked my son to be a groomsman, included her parents of course, and even asked my ex (who has been estranged from my side of the family since the divorce) to be the usher. She made a wedding website with photos/descriptions of all of the people in the wedding party. My daughter is the only one not on there. \n\nMy niece didn\u2019t directly tell my daughter that she wasn\u2019t included. Instead she created a text group with all of the women in our families except for my daughter to plan hair/makeup/etc for the day of. My daughter was with me and my other nieces when we got the text and didn\u2019t have her phone on her, so she assumed she was included as well. Turns out she wasn\u2019t. When I reached out to my niece for clarification, she stated that my daughter was not going to be included. When I asked her if my daughter could at least get ready alongside us in the bridal suite (doing her own hair and makeup), my niece said no. Her exact words were \u201cthere won\u2019t be any room for her.\u201d\n\nMy daughter is understandably crushed and has no idea why she would be the only one not included. When she and my niece finally spoke about it, my niece wouldn\u2019t explain why she had done this or apologize. Her only words were \u201cIt was my decision to make. I\u2019m sorry that you feel upset about it. I hope you can get over it.\u201d\n\nI never saw my niece as a mean person but I am questioning my view of her now. I don\u2019t want to participate in a wedding where my daughter has been singled out/excluded for no real reason. I can\u2019t think of anything my daughter could have done to offend my niece. It seems that my niece can\u2019t come up with a single reason for excluding her either.\n\nWhen my niece asked me to be a bridesmaid, I didn\u2019t know that she was planning on asking everyone else in the family except for my daughter. I wouldn\u2019t have accepted if I had known this.  Am I the asshole if I tell my niece that I won\u2019t be able to fulfill my commitment as a bridesmaid and just attend as a guest? \n\nI\u2019ve already posed this with my daughter and she thinks that me and her brother should both still participate because she doesn\u2019t want to be blamed for our dropping out. If I do decide not to participate, I will be making it clear to my niece that it was 100% my decision to drop out because I feel personally disrespected that she would treat my daughter this way. I\u2019m torn on how to handle this.\n\n(Edit: daughter is 22 and niece is 34)", "My son and I were very close. My ex and I divorced when he was 7.

I got through it because of that boy. I started going to his sport gamed and he asked me not to.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I am paralyzed, I have no bowl or bladder control. I don't even know if I have to go. Since I am hooked up to a catheter and wear diapers. I have a urine and colonstomy bag on the side of my chair. If I try hiding it, but sometimes it leaks. Plus, if not attached correctly then I can get an infection.\n\nMy son is embarrassed about this when I show up at his games not only in a chair but with bags. Last week, my bag was leaking and I didn't know until some told me. My son asked me to come to his games anymore because of it all. \n\nIt hurt me so much that I cut him off.

Unlike her I go to a local community college and asked what it is like for her living in a dorm and what kind of rules she had to follow. This led her to tell me about the sensitivity education she had received, partially towards minorities and what is to be considered offensive to certain groups but not obviously offensive in the perspective of the person making the statement. She gave me an example and said that telling a black person \"I like your hair\" is a microaggression.\n\nI told her that is ridiculous and borderline insanity to say that giving a compliment to someone is considered offensive. After hearing what I said she got considerably upset and said that I was a mildly racist and told me to get educated because we live in the year 2019. So AITA because I haven't caught up with the current social norms or is she being ridiculous?", "Ok, so all my other friends think ITA for going ahead with this but I disagree. \n\nMe, my friend and his gf are all living in the same house right now as housemates, but our contract soon runs out so we have to look for new places. \n\nI've been looking tirelessly for the best part of 5 months, I've viewed at least 30 properties (I'm very picky) and a couple weeks ago I found the perfect flat. Cheap, close to work and has enough room for me, my dog and an office for work/gaming. I was over the moon when I found this place and told the landlord I was very interested and he would contact me soon to see if I got the place after I filled in the application. \n\nAnyway, fast forward to yesterday and I was told my application was successful and if I wanted the place I need to contact them by tomorrow. Thrilled, I told my friend and his gf and they were really happy for me. They asked me about the place, what it was like, how much did it cost and where was it so we can visit each other if they were close to the place they saw, and then, I showed them the place and their faces dropped. It turns out that place was the same place they applied for (the only place they actually looked at, I think).\n\nThey told me they were hoping to get the place pretty much for the same reasons as me and the gf (a student interior designer) wanted the place since the landlord said he'd give her free reign to redecorate the place. They called it their \"dream place\" and it was the only one in such a nice area that they could afford and was large enough for a couple (everywhere else for that price was only single beds, this one was a double). \n\nWhat they said I could do is speak to the landlord and recommend them instead and chances are they would get the place (their words, not too sure if that's true). Thing is, I want this place. I looked at dozens of places and it's also kinda my \"dream place\". My friends think I'm being selfish since I technically don't need all that space whereas they do  but I don't think that's a good enough reason. It's my future apartment, I should live in the place I want. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I told them no, I'm getting the place, they can't have it?\n\nEdit: so, my friend found this post (didn't know he followed this subreddit) and put 2 and 2 together. He knocked on my door to tell me he saw it and I thought he was gonna be pissed. Turns out he actually read your comments and he also got to see it the way I saw it and he actually apologised and said he didn't want this to damage our friendship, and I should take the place without worrying. I'm so relieved it worked out this way and I have called the landlord to take place. Thank you guys, you were a real help here, honestly.\n\nEdit 2: oh damn I went bed with 1k upvotes and woke up with 5k. Thank you all. Anyway, I spoke to the gf over breakfast today and she told me she understands where im coming from and it was stupid of them to try and force me into getting them that flat when we both equally deserved it and she apologised. Apparently, however, she isn't the problem, her friend is. She's been telling other people that I forced them out of the flat for no good reason so that's becoming it's own drama. She's not my friend though, she's theirs so I honestly couldn't care less, I'm just happy I got this amazing flat. Thank you guys again for the upvotes, the silver and all the great advice, you were all a great help.", "My boyfriend's twin brother had his bachelor party on Saturday. We discussed boundaries before he left, I said I didn't mind if he went to a strip club, but I did not want him to touch any of the dancers or get a lap dance. No problem, he readily agreed and I thought we were done with it, I totally trusted him.\n\nSunday afternoon we're laying in bed, and he confesses to getting a lap dance. He said the other guys bought it for him and he was super drunk, and that he was sorry. He also said he got up after a minute and she didn't finish the dance. I appreciate that he told me the truth, but I'm still really mad that he disrespected that boundary after agreeing to it. He didn't have to accept the dance, he could have stood up and left. Shame on me for asking for more details, but apparently he had his hands on her the whole time, got an erection, and enjoyed it. Now I can't stop picturing it. I'm totally grossed out and super disappointed in him.\n\nSo guys, am I the asshole for being mad and having unrealistic expectations, or am I justified in being angry?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'd like to say thank you to everyone who took the time to respond to this post. I sat here last night/this morning and read through everything. Both sides of the argument made excellent points, and I do think there was a lot I did not initially consider. I don't think I'm a doormat, nor do I think I have confidence issues. I think I made a reasonable request that was then violated. I don't think my boyfriend is an asshole though. He messed up, but there was a lot more at play than I initially realized. I don't know if I'd necessarily make the same request of him in the future. We talked a lot yesterday, and we're going to work through it. ", "Using a throwaway because this is a sensitive topic.\n\nMy wife and I have always wanted biological children. We were both clear about that when we got married. She got pregnant soon after we married, but we lost the pregnancy. We learned that the reason is that she has an issue with her uterus (not getting specific for anonymity reasons). The issue can likely be remedied with surgery. However, any pregnancy post surgery would automatically be classified as \"high risk.\"\n\nMy wife refuses to get the surgery. She's scared off by the idea of surgery and \"high risk\" pregnancy. I have been putting pressure on her to get the surgery for the last year because I think she owes it to us to at least try, since we got married with the understanding that we wanted biological children. She exploded at me yesterday and accused me of thinking of her as an incubator. I certainly don't, but I do feel cheated that she's not putting in her all to follow the plan that we both explicitly wanted at marriage. Am I the asshole for pressuring her into following our original plans?", "This happened earlier when I met up with my mother and aunt at a restaurant. We pulled at the same time and I was walking in front of them wearing a crop top and some shorts. She goes on to say\n\nAunt:  your so skinny it\u2019s disgusting. It doesn\u2019t even look like you eat. \n\nWe go inside the restaurant and she says\n\nAunt: you need to cover up no one wants to see that. \n\nAnd she says this so loud that everyone looks over at us shocked. My mom finally tells her to drop it  and she does. \n\nWe leave the restaurant and she starts up again\n\nAunt: your so skinny you make me sick. You should gain some weight no one wants a toothpick. \n\nI finally decide to clap back at her and say \u201csorry not everyone\u2019s fat like you and can feel confident in their body\u201d\n\nMy mom told me to apologize and when I refused my aunt left all mad and now my mom said I\u2019m wrong and I fat shamed her. AITA for mentioning her weight?", "I'm 29M, she's 28F. I come from a poor family but am highly educated, she comes from a rich family but has never had a job. We're both only children. We became engaged last Christmas but have been seeing each other for 5 years. I only learned her family is wealthy about three years into our relationship.\n\nShe sprung on me two days ago that she and her family want me to sign a prenuptial agreement before we get married to \"protect her\". The prenup details are essentially that we retain financial independence and neither of us are entitled to whatever we make during the marriage, with assets split accordingly. This was never mentioned before so I assumed there would be none. We talked a bit and I decided to call off the engagement and wedding (more like postpone it until we can work it out) and everyone from all sides is calling me an asshole. I'd love AITA's opinion on if I am being one or not.\n\nWhen we get married, it was floating around that her parents would buy us a house in a more rural area near them. My fiancee was all raring to go with this idea but I'm apprehensive, especially with a prenup as they described. My job prospects dramatically diminish if we do, because my job is very technical and really only found in bigger cities. Unless I could find remote work, my options are either not following my degree's career path or commuting 6\\~hr each day, the latter of which is impossible I think we all can agree on. Signing a prenup means my capability to make money is diminished with zero security yet it would be foolish not to take that opportunity as it would eliminate rental costs from the equation.\n\nSay I can make $90,000 in the city but only $40,000 where she wants to move. If we lived there for 10 years then get divorced, that's $500,000 of potential earnings I've lost. Signing the prenup means I can recoup precisely none of it. I would sign the prenup if we stayed where I can make the most money, or I would move if I don't sign it. I just won't do both. It would put me at a disadvantage because in a divorce in that situation, I'd be out of work in my career field, no house, and 10 years behind on my career. No one is going to hire a 40 year old with little experience in my career path.\n\nI'm not a gold digger, if her parents pass and give her their vast wealth, I would hope in the event of a divorce that she kept the lions share. I would never expect 50/50, but I would expect compensation for my losses. To get married and move to where she wants to move, I need to give up my career, basically, something I wouldn't do otherwise. I love my fiancee but I need some kind of security in that I don't give up my career for nothing. My earning potential would be more or less halved if we got married and moved, and I want security in that I'm not giving up that opportunity for nothing.\n\nI tried to compromise in two ways: I'd sign a prenup that said it was dissolved after five years. Her parents are worried we'll get married, I'd ditch her in the first year, and take their money. At least this shows commitment on my end. I also considered a prenup where it becomes dissolved if my fiancee shows infidelity, something she was vehemently against. I don't know why that would be a problem, but the fact she won't is a red flag. I can't sign a prenup that benefits her if she can ruin our marriage at any time.\n\nUltimately, I thought our love was unconditional but apparently not. Because I won't sign a prenup that's not in my best interest, I don't want to get married. We can remain common law forever, it's not like a wedding is necessary or mandatory, anyways.", "One Sunday around 8:30 P.M I decided that I wanted pizza. I placed an order online with Domino\u2019s for a pretty standard pizza and set it to delivery with payment as \u201ccash.\u201d The tracker online said \"35-45 minutes.\" (They close at 11:00)\n\n1 hour has passed. I called to check on the status of the pizza. The manager answered the phone and asked what I would like to eat. I mention my order number, the estimated time, and what the ETA was. The manager replied, \"oh, that was just sent out; you should get your pizza soon.\" \n\n30 minutes go by and no pizza has arrived, and the online tracker is now bugged. I call again and get the same manager. I explain to her that I was the guy who called earlier and I am checking in on the pizza. She then tells me, \"Oh, the driver said you canceled that order.\" To which I matter of factly say, \"No, I didn't.\" She then told me she would check with the driver but then hung up. I call in again and she instantly picked up the phone and hung up. This happened 3 more times. I then call and get put into a hold where domino's promotions are just looping. \n\nI simply order a new pizza from hot box and decide to stop by Domino\u2019s on my way there.\n\nI make my way to their building, and I see: chairs on tables, oven off, one driver sitting and texting, and the manager texting at the counter. I then call from my cell. Manager looks at the phone, eyes the screen, and lets out a very visible sigh. She hung up the phone instantly while the driver looked up and laughed. \n\nI casually walked in and went up to the counter. She looked up from her phone and asked what I would like. I say in a low, snide tone, \"I would like \u201cX\u201d pizza, oh wait, that's actually the pizza I ordered from hot box because you guys are so incompetent that you couldn't deliver a pizza in 2 hours or see fit to answer your phones, have a good night.\" Two middle fingers on my way out. As I'm driving away, both the manager and driver come out and flip me off to which I return the favor. I then drove to hot box. \n\nI pull into a side street to park on the curb, and the man in the car behind me honks. I figure I just took someone\u2019s parking spot. As I put my car in park and get out, it's none other than the driver. He then gets out of his car and says, \"Where do you get off talking to my manager like that!\" I don't think I've ever been angrier in my entire life. I screech, \"YOU GUYS FUCK UP THAT BADLY AND HAVE THE AUDACITY TO BITCH WHEN YOU GET CALLED OUT; ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?!\" Taken back, he mutters \"Well, you're not welcome at Domino's anymore.\" To which I rail, \"ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED? WHY THE FUCK WOULD I EVER EAT AT DOMINO'S AGAIN AFTER TONIGHT?\u201d He then threw his hands up and drove away.\n\nEdit: A few details based on the thread and what I've read. 1. I am a man, not sure how I became a she. 2. I did not yell in the store, only on the road 3. Only the manager and delivery man were there in the store, and I only spoke to the manager", "So basically, the place me and my boyfriend live doesn't have a washing machine. His mom kindly told us we can use her machine when we visit, which is usually twice a week. We arrived with our laundry but she was using the washing machine was in use. We waited, but then I realized I can't wait around because I had work. I told my BF to just chuck the clothes in (mostly my underwear and 1 dress) when the washer was done. So I leave and come back to ask my BF where my clothes are. He said that he only did one load before he needed to leave so he just left the clothes there for next time. Ok cool. We went there 2 days later and ask his mom where my stuff is. She doesn't know. I look everywhere and think hmmm that is weird I really need to wash my underwear. 2 more days pass and I ask her again where are my clothes? She said that she \"thinks\" she threw them away while cleaning her house. She said she didn't know who they belonged to so she just threw them away and she is very sorry.\n\nWELL I was really upset about this. First of all this felt really personal. None of my BF's clothes were missing plus she lives with her two teenage daughters who have very similar Victoria Secret underwear to mine and none of there stuff was missing either. Of course they are just clothes, I can always get new stuff but for me it is about the principle. I told my BF that I need her to pay me back for what she threw away. At least $100 since she also threw away a dress of mine. He thinks I'm being an asshole for no reason. He said \"YoU HaVe PleNTy Of mOnEY JuST BuY NeW OnEs\" and also \"IT WaS aN AcCiDenT\" Again It is about the principle. If I \"accidentally\" threw away her stuff I would be expected to pay for its replacement and I would do it because I'm not a shitty human. I've asked his mom for the money and she said she will pay me \"soon\" whatever that means. I'm sure she will, but now the whole family, including my BF act like they have some problem with me. They don't treat me the same and all I can think of is \"HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU MAD AT ME!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Just to clarify, We offered to pay for laundry in the begging but she refused to accept it so I didn't offer after a while. We bring our own soap and take our wet clothes home to hang dry in the sun usually. She doesn't have a dryer so we either hang them there or at home. The clothes were left in a green laundry basket that my BF mom gave to him. Also, his mom was not doing our laundry we were just using her machine.", "It's safe to say that I am a dog person. I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.\n\nI definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.\n\nIt is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.\n\nAll of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.\n\nI've tried to talk to my girlfriend about the issue and she just turns stone fucking cold.\n\n\"Hey maybe (cat) can live with your parents when we move in together.\" (They are in the same city as us.)\n\n\"No. We're a package deal.\"\n\nI tried very calmly and rationally explaining to her the issue and she outright said that I need to figure out what's more important to me because either they both move in with me or we break up and stop wasting each others' time. Just full ultimatum and holding the relationship hostage.\n\nI feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. If she's playing hardball, would it be an asshole move for me to play hardball right back and say that she can't move in until she rehomes the cat?", "AITA for calling and chewing out the reverend of my wifes church. I was opening the mail and got this letter today\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/yOlHLXo\n\nI was kind of outraged that they sent a letter out almost shaming those that didn't contribute to the church. To me the letter read that he was disappointed in those that gave nothing financially to the church. That just doesn't sit well in my book and the more I stewed on it the more frustrated I got. I ended up calling and essentially saying that those that contributed nothing or little should not be shamed with a number game sent in the mail. If anything you should be sending a letter to those that contributed nothing letting them know that the church has resources available and that they will always be welcomed to contribute spiritually. He sounded shocked and said finances are a huge part of the church. I kind of went off at that point and said I would be switching memberships. Anyhow I feel like an asshole for taking this to the extreme with them.\n", "Update:I spoke to him turns out he is clueless about the UAE.\nHe apologized to me.

I have no problem with it but I am afraid for his safety in the UAE so I told him when we go to the UAE he shouldn't tell people he is gay.\n\nHe got mad at me and called me a homophobe I told him I am looking out for him and he told me I shouldn't of trusted you people and blocked my Instagram and number and ignores me at work.\n\nI didn't mean to offend him I was looking out for him\n\nEdit:I am asking since I am still pretty new to American culture is this offensive for Americans?\n\nEdit: I called my friend and told him to explain the situation to my gay friend (my gay friend doesn't wanna talk to me) I will tell you guys what he says \nAITA?", "So I\u2019m 24 yrs old and recently got out of a 5 year relationship a few months ago. About a month ago I decided to see what all the hype was about and hopped on tinder for the first time. Within an hour or so I matched with this girl who I\u2019ll call Allie for the sake of the story. Allie actually messaged me first, typical small talk and then it eventually led to more detailed conversation about each of our lives. Allie and I seemed to have a lot in common and had the same sense of humor. Eventually we take our conversation over to text and this continues for a few weeks. We talked over the phone a few times but every time I asked if we could FaceTime it was never a good time for her so we mostly just stuck to texting. Fast forward to 2 days ago we finally met up at a local coffee shop and I almost didn\u2019t recognize her. She looked nothing like she did in her photos. Looking back on it I should have seen the red flags. Most of her photos were selfies taken from the chest up, heavily filtered, or photos taken from a distance and then photoshopped to make her look thinner(slim/curvy). When I saw her in person there was nothing curvy about her she was just morbidly obese, plain and simple. Obviously looks are not the only thing that matter in a relationship, as I said we had a lot in common and actually got along really well over text but being physically attracted to a partner is something that means a lot to me as well. I guess that I was very short with her during our time and the coffee shop and didn\u2019t seem interested in conversation, I wanted to make it clear that I wasn\u2019t interested. She asked if I wanted to come to her place afterwards, I politely declined.\n\nAfter I got back home I texted her and told her that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re right for each other and wished her the best. Her response was \u201coh\u201d. So a few hours go by and she sends me a text and says\u201dwhy don\u2019t you think were right for each other? I thought that things have been going great, I really liked you a lot\u201d. Instead of sugar coating things I straight up told her that I felt like I had been catfished, she look nothing like she did in her photos. She responds back \u201chow so?\u201d and I told her that she was overweight and I\u2019m not really into that. She then sends me a long string of messages saying that I\u2019m a piece of shit, I\u2019m body shaming her, I\u2019m just like \u201ceveryone else\u201d she thought I was different and I\u2019m the worlds biggest asshole for wasting her time and \u201cleading her on\u201d. Yesterday I received some messages from her friends and sister on Instagram calling me disgusting for body shaming and basically just regurgitating what Allie had already said to me.\n\nAITA? I just don\u2019t get how people expect to find a partner whenever they lie, and catfish all of their photos. You\u2019re targeting people that probably aren\u2019t actually interested in you and in the process you\u2019re probably excluding the people that are actually into that body type by portraying yourself as something you\u2019re not. My intentions were not malicious.", "My brother is getting married in a few months. I have been asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nI'm in my early 30s and have been getting tattooed once every year or two since I was 20, so by now I have a number of tattoos, they're all well-done and no offensive/shocking designs. Mostly they are nature and abstract art. No one in my family really likes my tattoos, but it's not their body or their money so their comments never bothered me much.\n\nSometimes good tattoo artists have LONG waiting lists. There's an artist I've been trying to get an appointment with for years and recently his receptionist contacted me saying they had appointments available. I booked one and got a new piece a few weeks ago. It never occurred to me to think of the wedding before getting it done, and besides, I already have so many tattoos that why would one more make any difference? \n\nBut my brother saw the tattoo in one of my social media photos and contacted me upset that my new tattoo will be a distraction during the wedding and in the pictures. The dress that he and the bride picked for the wedding party is short and strapless. I offered to wear a different outfit that covers more skin, but they also think it would be distracting for me to not match the rest of the party. \n\nI asked why my older tattoos didn't bother them but the new one did, and they said it's because they \"had to accept\" the old ones and thought I'd \"respect them\" by not getting any more. I don't really understand how it has to do with respect. \n\nAITA for not thinking of the wedding pictures before booking my tattoo? I'm married, I get that wedding photos are expensive and you want them to look good, but I don't think it's right to dictate your wedding partys appearances other than choosing their clothes.", "Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\n\nEdit: Yes yes this post is ironic, it\u2019s just shitty 3AM meta that I farted out in my sleep.", "throwaway just incase. \n\nme and my girlfriend have been dating for 2 years, I'm 25 and my girlfriend is 24. \n\nlast week my brother shared a post from a weed lovers Facebook page and included a funny caption. he has 2 kids and almost never smokes weed, maeby once a month at the most, and the kids are never home when he does. he also has no weed paraphernalia at his house. \n\nmy girlfriend saw the post and questioned me on it, I explained exactly what I just told you and reassured her that the kids are fine. \n\nI then get a call from my brother a few days later, telling me that someone called CPS on him as they just did a welfare check on his kids. I automatically knew it was my girlfriend and confronted her, she told me that weed is bad for you and she was only thinking in the kids best interests. \n\nI just started yelling at her. \n\nI told her that I had explained to her how little weed he uses and that it's never kept at the house, I was beyond mad and made sure she knew that, I explained that she called CPS on a man who smokes weed once a month and that she is the worst person I've ever met. this caused her to start crying and she sobbed In the shower for an hour, and then tried apologizing but I refused her apology i also told her to not even bother apologizing to my brother as he does not want to see her. \nI then broke up with her. \n\nnow I've accepted that we have broken up but now that my brain has cleared up I think I went a step to far and really need outside judgment on this. \n\nI'm just a complete mess of emotions.\n\nedit  \n\nI want to add that I've stayed with my brother and I've been super close with him and he definitely only smokes once a month. even his friends have agreed with me on that. \nI trust my brother and the kids are perfectly healthy", "My ex was everything I wanted in a partner except for ambitious.  That\u2019s what proved to be our downfall.  He was a \u201ckitchen assistant\u201d at his uncle\u2019s restaurant.  Basically washing dishes, bussing tables, and general cleaning.  I tried talking to him about looking for other work, something he could make a future in, but he was happy there.  \n\nSo I broke things off.  I thought it best to be straight forward with him about it.  He didn\u2019t yell or cry or anything really until I had finished.  Then he coldly told me that he would eventually take over for his uncle when he retires and had been being trained on how to run the business for years, was that ambitious enough for me?   \n\nI tried to say yes!  It was literally all I wanted was to know that he had his sights set higher than washing dishes for the rest of his life, but my ex kicked me out of his apt and wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with me afterwards.  \n\nThe way it all played out has always bothered me.  He treated me like I was an \u201casshole\u201d just because I wanted to know he had bigger plans for himself and us in the future. ", "My wife and I are out of town, I didn't want to post this on my regular account since I've spoken on the sub about what there is to do here and I want to protect everyone's privacy. The timeline here is also not exact just for privacy reasons. \n\nMy wife is 26, we've been married for 5 years and have a great and fun marriage. Her \"free pass\" has always been John Krasinski  which I always thought was kind of a fun little joke between but after the way she's been acting since yesterday I'm starting to think she might be serious. \n\nSo here's how it went down. We were out and I ran into JK (just because I don't want to type Krasinksi out again) outside a men's room. It was one of those \"wow\" moments because it was really him. I sort of gave him a nod and turned around to make sure it was him and another woman came up to him and asked for a picture and he told her bluntly but politely that he was there with his wife and had promised her he was like 100% hers that day. The girl was like \"oh my god that's so sweet, nice to meet you anyways.\" So when I got back to where we were sitting I told my wife \"you aren't going to believe this but JK is here.\" She was totally hung over but she like instantly had a shot of coke and perked up. She spotted where he was and was like \"oh my god it's really him, of course he's with the hottest woman ever.\" I was like \"yeah babe, they've been married for like 20 years.\" She replied with \"I know, stupid.\" I was like wow...  She grabbed her phone and tried to run over and grab a pic with him. \n\nI was like no, no, no I just heard him say that he didn't want to take any pictures. She said she didn't care. I grabbed the back of her dress and sort of guided her back to sitting down. I told her what he had just said by the bathroom. She didn't want to believe me and then accused me of asking for the picture and \"ruining it for her.\" I told her that actually no a more rational and sane woman had asked for the picture and JK had politely shut her down. My wife snapped at me and told me  \"that bitch obviously wasn't a big a fan I am.\" I begged her to at least calm down and we'll wait until JK and his wife are outside and we'll try to politely catch them on the street. My wife got all pouty and put her sunglasses on as I guess her hangover had caught back up to her. Our server came over and asked for our order and in that time JK and his wife had left. Wife went sprinting out of the restaurant with her phone but came back sulking so I guess she didn't find him. \n\nMy wife is pissed, like sulking like a 4 year old and while I thought maybe it was like a \"fun\" thing...it's not. She's legitimately mad. I'm sure she'll eventually get past it but right now is the most awkward time I've ever spent with her. \n\nWas I the asshole? Should I just allowed her to go over and make a fool over herself even though I had the information that he didn't want to take any pictures? I feel like I did the right thing but she's making me feel terrible.", "Let me just start off with \"it's not about the money\". This is just the final straw, at least from my perspective.\n\nI'm my family's first born, but I'm a girl. My brother is a boy, and we both hail from a patriarchal (european, christian) family, where it's expected that women should both study, find a job, marry, have kids, but also not be stingy over their share of inheritance, that usually goes to their brothers.\n\nWhich is ok, I have my own life, I'm a grown up person and I don't rely financially on my family, nor do I need anything from them. It still kinda hurts.\n\nIt began when I was 7 or 8, when I had to do choirs that my brother was excused from because he was a boy. His driving lessons were paid for, mine weren't. When my father planned on getting remarried (he divorced my mother), he told me he can't have two women living under the same roof and that I should move out, so his wife could move in. So I did move out. Now, I'm in my 20s, I don't live with them anymore, but when I come over, my grandpa and grandma ask me to iron my brother's shirts, vacuum the place, wash the dishes. When I ask them why can't my brother do it (he lives with them), they say: \"He's a man\". As if having a penis makes you physically incapable of ironing your own damn clothes. I sometimes do some of this stuff, but only because my grandma is old and I can't watch her being acting as a house slave for every male in my family.\n\nFrom their perspective, I'm probably selfish and I understand that. They paid for my education, cared for me when I was sick, tried to minimize the traumas I had in my life from things irrelevant to this story, and they loved me in their own way,  They do love me and they do care for me. Things aren't that black and white. I love my brother, we're close and we'd die for each other, if we had to. I love the rest of my family as well (some more than others).\n\nThis isn't a big thing since I don't rely financially on them and I don't live with them, but these little things carve themselves into the picture you have of your family.\n\nEDIT: Somebody told me to edit the post to clarify my brother's stance. He wants to share the inheritance with me and he had his share of problems with my family, just like I did, just not regarding the inheritance. He's a true bro.", "My boyfriend of over a year and I are going to an out of country destination for a week in March. I love him a lot but he can be juvenile and I find myself feeling at times like a mother and child dynamic.\n\n\n\n\nHis passport has been expired since May 2018, and I have brought it up several times to get it renewed. We have even had a tiff or two over it. In November, we booked and paid for this trip. It cost about 1000$ each. \n\n\n\n\nThe deadline of him needing to have his passport sent off so he can get it back in time is approaching quickly. I guess I'm asking preemptively to this so I know if I'd be an asshole if I followed through with what I am currently intending on doing : I'm not going to say shit and let him deal with the consequences if he doesn't get it together on time. I'll have a lovely vacation on my own. \n\n\n\n\nBe honest. Would that make me an asshole to knowingly let him miss out on our trip and lose the 1k?\n\nEDIT\n\nThank you so much to everyone who answered and gave me advice. I love my bf and I do want to take the trip with him and I don't think this is the rock I want to die on. I'll give him ONE more reminder and then I'll let him decide his course. To all the NTA people telling me I'm not his mom and he needs to get his shit together - you are SO right. I know I can't describe all the intricasies of our relationship in a text post but just know that he is a super worthwhile character. But it's time for the tough love card,  even if it's not going to be over this trip. \n\n\n**EDIT2** \n\nI gave the adamant 'this is the last time I'm bringing it up, I spent money on this trip too and I'm going with or without you' warning. Then I dragged him out and got his passport photos - he was cranky about it initially but when it only took 5 minutes he admitted it was nice to have it done. Now I can truly feel like I've done all that I reasonably can without tying him to the hood of the car and driving him to the office myself. Again, thanks everyone. I'll try and get replies out/ keep everyone posted as to what happens.", "My ex wife and I shared custody of our daughter after we got divorced. My daughter was 7 when we got divorced. Everything was really fine, but when she turned 16, she claimed that I was harassing her. \n\nI was really shocked and devastated when I learned that my own daughter was doing this to me. The courts did not find anything amiss, but my reputation in our community was destroyed. I had to sell my business, move to another state and start over again. I got married again and I'm happy. \n\nMy daughter is 24 now and she's sorry now. She wants a relationship with me now. But I've really distanced myself from everything and I don't want a relationship with her anymore. But my wife thinks I'm being unfair and I should give my daughter a chance. AITA here?", "Before I describe what happened, it is probably relevant to mention that, though not officially diagnosed, I exhibit some characteristics which might place me on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. (I grew up in a country where there is a paucity of understanding, even among medical professionals, about the disorder, so I never got diagnosed. I now live in the USA.)\n\nThis happened a few weeks ago, at the start of this month. My manager Anne was showing the new hire Jane around the office, and introducing her to everyone. Anne had ordered some cakes and drinks to celebrate Jane's hiring, and we all gathered around the dining table to break the ice with Jane.\n\nI don't remember how we ever got to the topic, but at some point during the conversation, Anne excitedly asked, \"How old do y'all think Jane is? You'd NEVER guess her age!\" Initially, Jane objected to having her age become the subject of speculation, but eventually relented in good spirits. (She was laughing in what seemed to me like a good-natured manner while giving her consent.) My colleagues started taking turns to throw out numbers in the 21-25 range, which invited more giggles from Jane.\n\nWhen it was my turn, I said, \"Mmm... You're probably around 35 years old, I guess?\" Immediately the joyous atmosphere dampened a little (even I could tell), but Jane quickly smiled and told me that I'd guessed correctly. I could infer that I'd made a faux pas, but fortunately everyone managed to move on quickly to other topics, and soon the conversation was flowing again.\n\nAt the end of the work day, Anne pulled me inside her office and told me (very gently and kindly) that I should have lied and told Jane that she looked younger than her actual age, because it would have made Jane feel more welcome in our company. Jane herself has not brought up the episode to me.\n\nI don't like hurting people's feelings, but at the same time, I also don't like lying, unless it is absolutely necessary. In this case, I don't think it is a grave insult to be told that one looks 35 when one is in fact 35. AITA for not lying? Should I lie in similar situations in the future?\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you, everyone, for your feedback. I have received lots of really great advice. Someone pointed out that I should have been able to infer that my coworkers were deliberately underestimating Jane's age and follow suit, but at that time I genuinely didn't think of that possibility. :-( I also genuinely didn't mean to use autism as an excuse, and I am sorry that it came across that way. I was trying to highlight that I have this particular shortcoming, so that people can give me suggestions on how to mitigate it. So, apologies again if it seemed like I was making excuses for myself. I moved to the USA early this year, and I am still trying to settle in. I have already made plans to get an official diagnosis later this year.\n\nIn the future, I will 1) decline to join in the game, or 2) borrow u/Sheephuddle's line \"I suspect you're too young to be worried about your age\", or 3) make light of the situation by making a patently absurd guess. That way I wouldn't have to lie, and I also wouldn't risk hurting anyone's feelings.", "I'm going to try cut a long story short here.\n\nBasically I'm getting married soon, yay me. My partners family has been heavily involved due to tradition and wanting the wedding to be somewhat traditional, which I have no problem with. The wedding is going to be traditional and their parents have helped with funding some of the wedding.\n\nNow we have no children, and don't plan on having any any time soon. However, their sister does, she has three. We've asked all of our friends and my family to not bring children to the wedding at any part during the day as we don't want kids there. Now I work with kids and have no problem with kids but I know that a lot of kids don't have very much spacial awareness for the scenarios there in. Therefore me, and my partner, don't want children at the wedding.\n\nMy family was fine with it, our friends are fine with it. Sister-in-law throws up a fuss.\n\nWe've hired out quite a nice place for the event and it comes with an on site secruity for the event. At my partners birthday party the other week my sister-in-law was adamant that she was bringing her children to the days proceedings. We argued for a bit but in the end I just told her that if she brings her kids to my wedding I'd have her and her kids ejected by secruity.\n\nWhile my partners on my side I'm getting a lot of fall-back from her family and it's just causing a whole lot of headache for everyone, I'm unsure how I'm going to solve it.\n\nSo AITA?

About 12 years ago, he called and said he had a rare form of cancer and that he had maybe two years to live. \n\nDevastated, I offered to help in any way I could. There are a few steps in the middle, but it ended up with me paying a couple of bills for him. \n\nHe was always a stand up guy, so I thought nothing of it. When he told me he went into remission, I was of course happy for him and with a few friends, we threw him a f*** cancer party. \n\nA year later, he had tumors on his brain that went away. \n\nThen, it was Fibromyalgia, which got better. \n\nThen he had another degenerative bone disease. \n\nThen he claimed to have epilepsy. \n\nYou get the point. He claims to have a disease. Gets an outpouring of attention. Then he gets better, or stops talking about it. \n\nAround 6 months ago, he called me in tears saying that he has been diagnosed with bowel cancer. \n\nI told him I didn\u2019t believe him. Told him I would if he sent me a copy of the diagnosis. It got ugly. He proceeded to attack me in our loose group of friends and online. Mutual friends are on his side. One even said: \u201cbut what if it\u2019s real this time?\u201d \n \nIn any case, I\u2019ve blocked all of them and ignore calls. I personally think he is an emotional vampire/terrorist and that it is very unhealthy for me (and him) to continue supporting these delusions. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone. I wasn\u2019t expecting this to be so obvious. I guess it wasn\u2019t to me because of the relationship. He was a great friend for a long time. I echo everyone who said it sucks. While it\u2019s nice to see that so many people understand my position, there is no \u201cvalidation\u201d for me, Just the knowledge that I\u2019ve lost a friend. As a note, I did mention the disorder to him and recommend he seek help. That is what triggered his anger. Thanks again everyone!\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who informed me that the correct name for the disorder is: Factitious disorder. Also, it is complete speculation on my part. Strictly based on the external symptoms. No official diagnosis that I am aware of.", "On Sunday afternoon I was shopping at the grocery store around the corner from my house. I don't want to say the name because I'm worried about this getting on social media and I'm almost positive I saw people filming with their phones (also posting from a one time use account for that reason), but it's a national chain that's focus is affordable health food. Think whole foods with bigger variety and way cheaper prices. Because of this, I know a lot of vegans and vegetarians shop there but this place has a full butcher shop, fish place and deli counter. It has vegan products but is not vegan to put it succinctly. \n\nI was in the soup aisle and I was checking out the bone broth when I hear something from behind me. Thinking back I THINK she said something like \"you shouldn't eat that, it's murder.\" But I honestly didn't hear her so I turned around and said \"thank you.\" This is all such a blur please don't quote me on any of this, it's just the best of my recollection. \n\n\nHer: \"your body will THANK YOU, as will all the animals.\"\n\n\nMe: really confused \"thank you.\"\n\n\nI set the box of broth I was looking at down and found a store brand that was much cheaper and put in my basket. \n\n\nHer: \"wait, I thought you weren't buying that?\"\n\n\nMe: \"excuse me?\"\n\n\nHer: \"you agreed that meat was murder.\"\n\n\nMe: \"no I'm sorry, I eat meat.\" \n\n\nThis is where I start to think something was really, really wrong with her. \n\n\nHer: \"you PROMISED me, you PROMISED me! No more animals will have to die. YOU PROMISED me.\" \n\n\nI just slowly turned away from her and went into the next aisle. She turned the other way so I figured I was done with her. Instead she looped around and met me coming the other way in the aisle I was in and kept screaming \"you PROMISED. you PROMISED!\"  and at this point she was in full tears, her face was red and now people sort of had us boxed in on both ends watching the \"show.\" \n\n\nI was livid at this point so I said (and this I can quote) \"look you stupid b!tch, I didn't promise anything. leave me the fuck alone.\" And with using that word I think I turned the crowd from being somewhat sympathetic in me dealing with the crazy person to me being an extreme asshole who was calling her names. She collapsed in a heap and I tried to excuse myself through the 4/5 people at the end of the aisle. I was shaking because I don't enjoy confrontation and I just set my basket down and went to the Safeway down the street but was a bundle of nerves the rest of the night. And I'm still dealing with it. I have no idea what came of the woman. \n\n\nThe look on those people's faces is haunting me (and i'm PRAYING this doesn't end up on youtube) and I feel awful for what I did. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nedit: why is this being downvoted so harshly?

I don\u2019t particularly want her here at the weekend because we wanna get drunk and have fun and not worry about a 12 year old being here. I said to my fianc\u00e9 can you ask her to stay at a friends or her grandparents at the weekend if she won\u2019t go back to her moms yet. So he asked her and she\u2019s being awkward and said she doesn\u2019t want to. So I said to my fianc\u00e9 well can you just force her to go to her grandparents then? And he was like, maybe we should just arrange to celebrate your birthday when she\u2019s gone back to her moms...I was like no? \n\nSo AITA for not wanting her here and thinking she should have to stay somewhere else that night?\n\nSo apparently I need to edit this because y\u2019all wanna jump to conclusions and need to know every little detail. \n\n- Yes there will be sex and other stuff going on at our party.

My fianc\u00e9 said she could stay for a while until everything calmed down a bit.", "Edit: Spelling and grammar.\n\nI was on a considerably empty flight. It was a 4 seat row plane, with 2 seats on each side. There was a family of 4 sitting near me, mom, dad, daughter and son that moved around quite a bit as there were many available seats to move about in and the kids (my guess girl was 8-9, boy told me he was 6) were for moving around but for the most part behaving. \n\nAfter take off, I took out my switch to pass the time and caught the little boys attention. He started asking questions, and I got the nod of approval from the dad so I started showing him BOTW gameplay. We still had about an hour of fly time, so I figured, why not, I\u2019ll let them play Mario Party. \n\nI asked the dad(he was closest to me) if it would be alright if they played a game. He seemed happy with the idea, until I handed one of the two controllers I had to his daughter. He said something to her in a different language I didn\u2019t understand, she fussed a little and then handed me back the controller saying she \u201ccan\u2019t play\u201d. It doesn\u2019t take much to put 2 and 2 together. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to defy her fathers wishes or make a scene, but I couldn\u2019t help ask why she couldn\u2019t play, hoping I was wrong. \n\n\u201cGirls shouldn\u2019t play video games\u201d, his face and tone so matter of factly. \n\nHe said this to me, a 27 year old woman, and I admit I got upset, but I couldn\u2019t argue. I just told him that if she couldn\u2019t play, I wouldn\u2019t let his son play either. This is when things went really south. \n\nThe son, of course got upset and started to cry a bit. The dad started raising his voice at me, and the daughter was trying to assure me it was ok, even though she was clearly sad. The wife tried calming her husband and kids, but she wasn\u2019t getting anywhere.\n\nI collected my controller from the son, and it hurt to pull away, but it just wasn\u2019t fair. I hated upsetting him, but as a girl who was once also told video games were boy only, I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that rule apply to my system. \n\nWe were near the back, so a flight attendant came around to check what was going on, and the dad went into a tirade about how I purposely dangled the video game in front of his kids then changed my mind to be cruel. I couldn\u2019t really explain myself, I just said I couldn\u2019t let him play if the sister wasn\u2019t allowed too. The flight attendant just looked at the father and said I didn\u2019t have to share if I didn\u2019t want to since it was my system, and he started ranting in another language. \n\nI asked to move, and he said yes as it was fairly empty flight. I moved to the front, but at this point all the passengers had turn to look at us, the now two crying kids and the angry father. \n\nIt been bothering me since it happened and I\u2019m wondering if I should have just let the boy play. It wasn\u2019t his fault his father set those rules, and I really tore me up having to pull the controller away from him.\n\nAITA for not finding a better solution? Or for offering in the first place? What should I have done?\n\n\nEdit: I came to this subreddit because I felt/feel incredibly guilty. I made a very impulsive decision based on my feelings and didn\u2019t consider the feelings of the boy until after I\u2019d changed seats. I was embarrassed because no one in the plane had really started paying attention until after both kids had started crying and the father was making a fuss. During the rest of the flight I kept thinking that if I had just played with the boy, and instead of upsetting the entire family and myself, it would have only been one person, not to mention the scene would have been avoided. I was embarrassed and mortified the flight attendant had to come over. Flights are tough on everyone and I definitely created waves, plus who doesn\u2019t feel guilty after making little kids cry? I\u2019d been torn about whether I did the best I could do or if I could have done something better. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll make any impact on the girls life, but I also ruined the flight for the family. Regardless, I\u2019ll probably forever remember this day as one of my least favourites, it\u2019s been a battle just trying to get over it.", "UPDATE (scroll down for original post):\n\nWow, this blew up! Firstly, I wanted to address a couple of comments:\n\n1. He doesn't have any allergies - obviously I wouldn't have ordered the burger if there was a chance it might cause him harm.\n\n2. This isn't part of some grand scheme to turn him vegan. I respect his right to eat meat, and I don't bother him about this. In fact, he's generally the only one to bring up my veganism (usually in the context of making fun of my food, which can get pretty exhausting).\n\nAnyway, after reading lots of the comments I apologised for giving him vegan food without asking for permission. He said I should apologise for making him look like an idiot by letting him brag about the \"beef\" burger when I knew it was fake. I said I was sorry about that, but also mentioned that he doesn't make me feel great when he makes fun of my food all the time. He's seen the message but he hasn't replied, I'm honestly kind of pissed off but I'll wait and see what he says.\n\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nI really don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole here, but his friends are saying I am so I wanted to get some opinions.\n\nI\u2019ve been a vegan for the past 2 years, whereas my boyfriend is adamant that he would never give up meat. He always complains about how vegan food doesn\u2019t taste as good, isn\u2019t filling etc, and he\u2019s normally not willing to try new things.\n\nAnyway, last night we were on a date at a burger chain. The chain lets you order with an app. He was busy on his phone and told me to order for him, and he wanted a beef burger. I asked which one and he said \u201cI\u2019m busy, you choose.\u201d\n\nI noticed that the restaurant sold the Beyond Burger - if you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a kind of \u201cfake meat\u201d burger which is designed to be realistic. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s actually really similar to meat, so I order him one mostly out of interest to see if he\u2019d notice. I got myself a bean burger, so he wouldn\u2019t notice we had the same meal and get suspicious.\nThe meal arrives and he really loves it! I kept subtly asking him how it was and he said it was great! He even boasted about it being tastier than my \u201clame\u201d veggie burger.\n\nAfter we\u2019d paid up, I told him the truth and he was pissed, saying I tricked him and violated his trust etc. But he loved the burger?? I think he\u2019s just feeling sensitive about being proven wrong, but he asked his friends and they\u2019re saying I\u2019m trying to control his diet and stuff. So AITA?", "This couple I\u2019m not very close with but the wife is a long-time family friend so I felt that I should invite her. To be clear, all of my invitations stated that there were to be no children at this wedding. But she and her husband showed up with their infant and toddler (who I think is like 3-4). \n\nAt the actual wedding ceremony, I let it slide. I was preoccupied for obvious reasons. I also thought that maybe they planned not to attend the reception or to have someone pick the kids up before it started. (My niece, who was our flower girl, and a few other kids who had to be at the wedding for one reason or another we\u2019re getting picked up/dropped off after the ceremony ended). \n\nAnyway the reception rolls around (I\u2019m fast forwarding through irrelevant details about the wedding but it was beautiful and everything went as smoothly as could be expected). The couple comes and, lo and behold, they still have their children.\n\nI had many other guests and didn\u2019t really feel like dealing with it so I asked our event planner to go over to them and discuss whether someone was picking up the child as the reception (and wedding, frankly!) were not supposed to have children. \n\nI mean, everyone was drinking and loud and rowdy and  a crying child and another little one running around was not part of the plan. (The infant  already had to be taken out once during the wedding ceremony because of fussiness and the toddler was, from what I could see, already appearing cranky). \n\nMy event planner went to talk to the couple. I could tell they were arguing with my event planner though so I went over to help him. I think they thought I came to rescue them because they started going on about how rude my event planner was. I explained that I had actually sent him over to discuss the children. I reiterated that the event was child-free and said that I had stated so clearly on my invitations. \n\nThe wife gave a sort of apology and then assured me that they were capable of minding their own children to make sure they didn\u2019t get in the way of anything. I said that wasn\u2019t really the point. That\u2019s when my now-husband comes over and he and the other woman\u2019s husband begin going back and forth and things got a little heated. \n\nFinally I snapped and said that they just needed to go, which, thankfully they did without much more noise. Still, the whole scene was incredibly embarrassing which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. \n\nI really hate that my wedding day had to be somewhat marred by this incident. According to my mother, everyone was talking about it and I guess enjoying a little dramatic entertainment. \n\nWas I the a-hole for making them leave?\n\n**Edit 1: Wow um this kind of blew up out of nowhere. Thank you all so much for the feedback. What I\u2019ve gotten from this is that most people think that the couple was rude. There are also a select few who feel that it\u2019s assholish to have a kid-free wedding at all which is...interesting.**\n\n**By way of an update, I have now learned that a few family members felt that it was inappropriate of me to kick out the couple. (The wife apparently is still angry about getting kicked out and the husband is FALSELY telling people that we threatened to call the cops on them). No one has said anything directly to me though.**\n\n**Anyway the feedback here has helped me not to feel guilty about that and just realize that not everyone has the same ideas about tact and manners.** \n\n**Edit 2: Well apparently this went somewhat viral and has now been in articles on Fox News, DailyMail, and Yahoo News. Many thanks to those in the comments who let me know! I had used a throwaway account to stay anonymous and lowkey, but I guess that\u2019s out the window lol.

Usually she comes in the evening, stays over, and then he leaves for work early in the A.M. while she kind of stays and leaves when she pleases.  Or she stays until he gets home and they spend some more time together.\n\nSo he usually leaves for work at around 5:00am, while I get up at around 6-6:30am and make my breakfast and start my day.  His girlfriend usually sleeps until like 10-11am, so I'm up doing stuff while she's still sleeping.  \n\nSince she's been staying over, I've received numerous texts from him while he's at work about how I need to be quieter while making breakfast because she's still sleeping, how I need to remember to put the toilet seat down for her, and that I'm being too loud in the morning.  I'll wake up, 'be too loud', she'll text him to complain and he'll text me.  It's ridiculous.\n\nI'm not banging pots and pans trying to ruin her sleep.  I'm simply going about my day.  If I'm listening to music or watching Netflix on my phone, I use headphones.  It's a small apartment with paper-thin walls so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do..  Wait 5 hours until she wakes up before I do anything? \n\n**My thoughts on this issue are as follows:**  She doesn't live here and has never once actually talked TO ME about these things.  She'll simply text her boyfriend and he'll send long texts about how he's 'told me many times'.  Honestly, I don't care how she feels.  She can put the toilet seat down herself. (I've received a few long messages about how I 'once again forgot to put the toilet seat down').  I live here and pay rent and if she doesn't like it she can go home (She drives to and from.  She's free to leave whenever).  But he seems to think that he's justified in his complaints about me not tip-toeing around her while she's over.  IMO he needs to just tell her straight up that she has no right to complain about these things.\n\nAITA?\n\n**EDIT** Okay guys, I'll put the damn toilet seat down.  And the lid.  But it's because I want to.\n\n**EDIT #2** Alright it looks like we're kind of torn between putting it down and leaving it up, for a variety of reasons ranging from *\"She's a strong independent woman\"* to *\"poop particles EVERYWHERE!\"*.  This is getting interesting.\n\n**EDIT #3** Thanks for the responses.  I read them all and learned a lot about bathroom cleanliness above all else, and going forward I will put the toilet seat down habitually, both so that the poop particles don't get everywhere and because it just looks more aesthetically pleasing to walk into a bathroom with a closed lid.  Yes, ***a closed lid***.  Ladies (and gentlemen, but especially ladies), observe the status of the toilet seat before you squat to avoid either falling in, or sitting on a closed toilet seat lid.

This guy was pretty overweight, but if he sat properly he would be fine.\n\nOn Metro trains, seats are grouped in four like\n\n\noo  \noo\n\nWith another set of four across. I got the lower left seat, but this selfish yobbo was on the upper right and had one leg across on the other, and his other leg taking up half of the seat on his right (across from me) an asian man took the seat, but could only sit on half of it.\n\nAt first I thought this guy was sleeping. I shook his leg several times and asked if he could move his legs to no response, when my voice started to raise a person said \"just drop it mate, hes not moving\". So whatever, I left him to his coma. We hit Richmond, he wakes up, looks at me, looks out the window. AND DOESNT MOVE. \n\nSo I see the asian man take a photo of his face, and I get an idea. Lets shame the asshole. So I take out my phone and start recording in selfie mode each time we arrive at the next stop, so the mic picks up the announcer saying \"now arriving at x\". I also shake his leg again, to which he tell me to bugger off. So now I can prove hes awake. Originally I was going to stitch it all together and post it in r/melbourne. But something better happened. When we got to one of the outer suburb stops, officers got on the carriage for inspection. He hears them asking for tickets and moves his legs. They come to us, I tell them, hey look at this. And show them a couple of the recordings.\n\nThey then issued him with a 180 dollar fine. Justice is sweet.\n\nThis happened two nights ago, and a couple of times I have been called a vindictive prick and that what i did was unnecessary. So, reddit.

Today I finally tried to break free from this. Whilst my parents were away I did everything I could think of, I shredded my leotards, destroyed certificates and threw away trophies and medasl, I then called my gym and told them how much I hated them, safe to say I'm not welcome anymore.

For the past few years, the neighbors and I have seen a growing amount of people come to our neighborhood for Halloween. This has caused a lot of people to \"turn off\" for Halloween, which you'd think would get the crowd to lessen but it keeps growing. I was openly annoyed with this leading up to Halloween and my girlfriend would condemn it every time I brought it up because \"Halloween's all about sharing\", saying it shouldn't matter whether the kids are from the neighborhood or not. She'd also point out that many of these children probably live in bad neighborhoods where it's not possible to trick-or-treat. Not surprisingly, this year at both entrances to the neighborhood, cars line the streets.. some with out of state plates (I live in a suburb of a city which is just over the state line.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed with parents who truck carloads full of kids to a neighborhood they don't live in?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Title is supposed to say \"neighborhoods\" not \"neighbors\". ", "So I just read a post that made me think of this incident from a few months back, and I\u2019m curious if ITA on this one. I needed to buy groceries one night, but I had had a really long day at work. So rather than walk down the street to the grocery store (literally a block away) I decided to just order them off Amazon, which is supposed to (and usually does) deliver directly to your front door. I have even put directions in the delivery notes section explaining exactly how to work the buzzer and get to my apartment in the building (it\u2019s not hard).\n\nI live in a rather large apartment building that\u2019s shaped like an L, so it\u2019s a bit of a trek to get to my apartment\u2019s actual door. I can also see the main entrance where we buzz people in because of my apartment\u2019s placement in the building.\n\nSo I\u2019m chilling at my kitchen table, playing on my phone and get a notification that my groceries are almost here. I then see a car pull up in front, check my phone, and confirm it\u2019s probably the delivery driver. I can see him checking his phone and looking at the building. He sits there for a minute or two and then starts calling on his phone. I get a call from the Amazon number.\n\nHe tells me that he has tried the buzzer several times, it\u2019s not working and he wants me to come meet him at the door to take my groceries. I\u2019m annoyed, since I saw him pull up and know very well that he didn\u2019t, but I feign surprise, ask him to try my boyfriends buzzer number (it goes to our cell phones) and call me back if it doesn\u2019t work. He tries to get me to come down to meet him several more times, then finally agrees in a clearly annoyed tone.\n\nI then watch him just sit in his car for another 2-3 minutes doing nothing, at which point he tries to call again. I\u2019m pissed now, since I figure he is just being lazy and the whole point of ordering the groceries (and having to pay tip) was that I didn\u2019t want to leave my apartment. So  I just ignore the call. He tries calling 8 more times and I refuse to pick up. I decide I\u2019m not picking up until he gets out of his car and actually tries the buzzer.\n\nInstead, he leaves an angry voicemail and drives off, marking my groceries as \u201cundeliverable.\u201d I immediately call Amazon customer service, explain that he sat in his car and never even tried to deliver them, and insist on a full refund, including the tip. They agree.\n\nMy boyfriend thinks I was an asshole for not just going downstairs to get the groceries, especially since I got the guy in trouble and we had to wait 2 hours to have the new order delivered. AITA?", "I have been brought up to respect my elders and have never done anything like this before. I think it was my adrenaline rushing and also I\u2019m super emotional because I am pregnant again. Yesterday I took my baby to Kohl\u2019s and while getting his stroller unfolded from the truck, I fucked up bad. I left my purse with keys and phone in the car, with the baby (to keep him calm while I get stroller ready for him). I close my trunk, come around to his door and it\u2019s locked. Every door is locked. It\u2019s 85 degrees out and I\u2019m just watching him play with my bag and I can\u2019t get in or call anyone. I immediately started screaming for help and a couple came over and called 911 and let me use their phone to call my husband. One guy ran to the autozone in the parking lot to see if they have something to break in. I was ready to break the window. People were running over and looking in my car, comforting me, calling for help. I was hysterical and nothing anyone said made me feel better. And then it happened: some older lady came up to the crowd and asked very loudly right next to me \u201cthe parents went into shop and left the baby in the car- they should be ashamed of themselves\u201d. And I lost it. I was screaming at her I don\u2019t remember what I said- I sort of blacked out. And it was in front of everyone there. I demanded she leave and go away. She was like my grandmas age. The police came and two guys each had this contraption of a balloon thing out between the car door and stuck a stick in to press the unlock button. From the first call to the door opening was 9 minutes but I thought it was an hour. The baby was alright, and never even cried. We hung out in the cop car to cool off while the crowd dissipated. This was all yesterday and the only thing I can\u2019t get over is how I treated that old lady in front of everyone. My behavior upset me more than the whole incident. AITA here", "Background info: My sister has a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. In January 2018, she told my family that she was pregnant with a third. She was over the moon, and she found out a few weeks later that the baby was going to be a boy. She publicly announced when she was 12 weeks pregnant, and miscarried in March at 14 weeks pregnant.\n\nShe was devastated by the loss. We arranged a full funeral, and she buried the remains in a cemetery. The headstone has the baby\u2019s name and \u201cbirth date\u201d, and she visits every week to put flowers on the grave. She joined a support group for parents who have lost a child.\n\nIn the last year and a half, all family events and celebrations have incorporated a celebration of her son\u2019s \u201clife\u201d. We all visited the cemetery on his due date last September to commemorate him. At Thanksgiving and Christmas, she set aside a little plate of food for him at the table and we visited the grave after dinner. She posts pictures on Facebook all the time of her two living children next to the grave, and captions it \u201cmy three babies\u201d.\n\nHis due date is coming up again this month, and she\u2019s already organizing a celebration at the cemetery for his \u201cfirst birthday\u201d. I\u2019ve dutifully gone along to all the other events, but this time I told her I wasn\u2019t willing to go. I tried to be gentle, but I ended up telling her that I think she\u2019s clinging to her grief and it isn\u2019t healthy.\n\nShe\u2019s incredibly angry at me. She\u2019s accusing me of invalidating her grief, and that I never cared about her son anyway. She said that he\u2019s her child and part of the family, and that she\u2019s incredibly hurt that I don\u2019t want to celebrate his life. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since I told her I wasn\u2019t going.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I care about her grief, and I get that having a miscarriage is a truly devastating event. But I also don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life having to pay homage to a dead \u201cchild\u201d that was the size of an orange. I mean... at 14 weeks you don\u2019t even need a surgical abortion, they\u2019ll just let you take a pill and miscarry at home. I don\u2019t want to have to go to a cemetery multiple times a year and listen to eulogies for a 14-week-old fetus for the rest of my life.\n\nI also think this focus on the dead \u201csibling\u201d has to be unhealthy for her two living children. I\u2019m not going to tell her how to parent, but I also feel that I\u2019m doing them a disservice by continuing to enable this kind of behavior. I don\u2019t want every family celebration to be focused on their dead \u201cbrother\u201d. She can do whatever she wants on the due date, but I don\u2019t want to play a part in it.\n\nAITA? I don\u2019t want to hurt my sister, but I\u2019m getting really concerned about how she\u2019s grieving a year and a half later.\n\nEDIT: Some people have written that I\u2019m an asshole for what I\u2019ve written here, particularly around how early the miscarriage was. I will not edit the post, but I hear you and will be more careful. Please be assured, though, that I have never said anything dismissive about it to my sister (unless you count the conversation I asked about as dismissive)\n\nEDIT2: Thank you all for your input. I\u2019m not able to respond to every comment but I am trying to go through and read them all.\n\nI\u2019m enormously relieved that most people don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole. I certainly don\u2019t want to be. But it\u2019s not a situation I have a lot of prior experience with, and I\u2019ve found it really difficult to navigate. So thank you for the input.", "Today I was sitting in class when I saw the guy who has bullied me for the past 2 years type his passcode in. It was 123450 so I could easily remember it.

Haahaha", "My daughter is 17 and pregnant. She doesn't want to abort and won't consider adopting. Before the baby we were planning to pay for our daughter's tertiary education. However, we have rescinded the offer of paying for her education. She is very upset. We would prefer her to stay with the baby and delay her college. She wants to have the baby and go off to college while my wife and I look after the baby. I don't want her to think she can leave the baby with us. My wife and I both work full time jobs and neither of us are ready for retirement. If she has the baby she has to look after it or get a job and pay for daycare. I have been speaking to a family friend and he says he might be able to get an admin job for my daughter which pays 2K/mo. It's a relatively simple job and would help a lot when the baby arrives. When the baby is old enough to go the school and she decides to get her college education I would be happy to fund her education then. After we sat her down and told her we won't be able to look after the baby and won't be paying for her education next year if she has the baby, she told my wife she's now considering abortion. \n\nAITA? I feel like we have unintentionally pressured her into getting an abortion. My wife thinks we've just forced her to stop and see her situation in a more realistic light.", "Back in May, a student of mine emailed me 2 days before when her final was scheduled. Her twin brother passed away early that night due to the negligence of a drunk driver. She said that she does not think she would be able take the final and asked if she would be able to reschedule. I sent my condolences and let her know that she could have as much time as she needed and that I will get in touch with her later in the summer.\n\nDue to administrative policies, Friday was the deadline to submit extended deadline grades. I told her she could take the test as late as July 16th if she wanted a grade for the semester. Alternatively, I could give her an incomplete, which is essentially the grade of \u201ccould not complete the class for extenuating circumstances\u201d. Lastly, she could apply for a leave of absence, and would be able to able to complete the final when she returns. She thanked me and told me she will get back to me with her preference soon.\n\nI emailed her again 3-days later and asked if she had a preference regarding what to do for her final. She didn\u2019t respond, so I emailed her again on June 24th, July 1st, July 8th, July 12th, and July 15th. I also mailed a letter to her place of residency that essentially said the same thing, and left a voicemail on her cell phone. \n\nShe failed to reply to any of my means of communication, including the ones that told her that without a response, I would be forced to give her a 0 for the final, which was worth 50% of her final grade. In order to qualify for an incomplete, she would have to sign a form and have it looked by both the professor (me) and her faculty advisor. The \u201cleave of absence\u201d is a Student Disabilities Services policy, so I couldn\u2019t do anything with her going through them.\n\nBecause she did not get back to me, I submitted a 0 for her final and she failed the class. I told my husband this morning  about what happened (he is also a professor at the same university) and he was completely aghast. He told me I should\u2019ve just made the final not count towards calculation for her final grade, or just say she got a passing grade on the exam. That would mean I would have to essentially lie, which I was worried because it would have looked suspicious if her other professors said she was similarly irresponsive to their emails. \n\nHe told me the other professors probably waived her final completely and what I did was morally reprehensible. He works in a different department, so he\u2019s used to having a lot more freedom regarding the grading scheme, but my hands were tied. We fought and he\u2019s insistence that I \u201cshould\u2019ve done more to help her\u201d.\n\nI get his perspective, but the fact is that she plainly did not respond to my messages. I did what I could, but he thinks I should\u2019ve just lied and hope I didn\u2019t get caught. Am I in the wrong for failing her?\n\n**EDIT:** I truly did not expect this response. I'm going to draft an email to my supervisors and see what can be done. I did not mean to argue with my judgment (that's why all of my comments were removed; I did not delete them). Whatever the case, I'm going to do what I can to make this right. Thank you guys.", "I work in an open insurance office, my desk is the very back one and not visible from our doors.

She didn't want to send her son to any daycare anymore, because she doesn't trust anybody else with her child.\n\nSo, she brings him into our office. Her son is a terror. She uses an iPad to keep him busy, but doesn't make him wear headphones. So, he sits in the office listening to cartoons at top volume, until he gets bored and starts running around, yelling. Whenever I tell my sister that it's distracting, she says he's just playing. He's walked into the conference room during meetings twice now, and my sister has just laughed it off. He'll draw on the whiteboard for a couple of minutes, maybe ask his mom for a snack or something, all while I'm trying to keep our client on track.

I was like, fine, okay, and then, he kept forcing it the wrong way and broke it. But I just said \"uh oh\" and suggested he play with one of his toys. He says no. He picks up a little toy car I have on my desk. Drives it off the desk. Okay, fine. Picks up a stress ball, rolls it off the desk, fine.

But I was sort of excited to go on a hike yesterday. We are in San Diego for the fourth of July and my cousin said it would be really fun if me and my friends went on a hike while she (cousin) had to work. We went to a place called Cowles mountain which I guess is about 45 minutes away from the hotel downtown. \n\nWhen we got there it was pretty crowded and we saw a group of guys coming down who were just blasting rap music. I was like wow that would be an awesome way to not get bored on the hike so I went back to my car and got my blue tooth speaker from my pack and hit my favorite spotify list. \n\nMost people didn't seem to mind but I did notice that we started to get occasional dirty looks. But finally one person stopped me and told me it was incredibly rude to play music outloud and that I should be using headphones. I told her that I was playing music for our group. And she basically that it's still very rude and against the rules but she kept walking. \n\nWe decided we just weren't going to make it to the top so we stopped at a kind of flat spot and sat down for a while and this is when things actually got kind of scary. This guy and his girlfriend came up to us and said again that I should be using headphones. I told her that we were in a group. She said that it didn't matter most people were trying to enjoy quiet nature. I told her that that its public land. She said \"if you weren't such an ignorant fat bitch you would have noticed the sign at the bottom that said no speakers.\" I basically shut down because I'm not good at confrontation but my friend asked her if she wanted to repeat herself. So the girlfriend called her a fat bitch as well and her boyfriend had to drag her away she was so upset. I didn't want any more hassle so I turned off the speaker and they walked away but the girl was just glaring at us and I was actually scared that they would slash my tires or something at the bottom. \n\nI have been reliving the confrontation over and over again and didn't sleep last night. I admit to being fully ignorant because I don't do a lot of outdoor stuff but was that really a big deal? I mean at least one other group we saw was doing it so I can't be that out of touch?

In his belongings were items that my mom has no idea of their worth. There were three of this item which she gave to my son and the other two grandsons.\n\nThen she pulled out three neatly ironed and folded table cloth napkins. They had been embroidered with the new last name of her great great (I don't know how many greats) grandmother from the late 1800s on her wedding day. This apparently was a custom back then for a new bride to do this and the napkins have been handed down for generations.\n\nThese were amazing, sentimental gifts. \n\nThere is only one problem however.\n\nIn the days after the reunion, my son went to have his gift appraised. Hold on to your seats for this.\n\nIt was appraised at $75,000.\n\nHe said he could sell it and do this and that with the money and I told him don't you dare. My mother obviously had no idea what she was doing and what the value of those items were. \n\nOf course, my daughter's napkin had no monetary value at all. \n\nI told him if he does sell it, to do so after mom dies (she is in her 80s), and that he should give half to his sister.\n\nHe sulked a little at this, saying that she has a college degree and works for a great company. He never went to college and doesn't make what she makes.\n\nI'm at a loss. AITA?\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Someone asked me why no one else in my family over the years sold the item. My mom's family didn't need the money. There were a lot of doctors and high society people in my mom's family. But mom was the rebel in her family and got tired of her parents telling her that none of her boyfriends were good enough so she took off and married my dad, an American soldier who was stationed there (France). That's why no one sold it. We didn't grow up like that though. \n\nAlso I am getting a fairly equal amounts of YTA and NTA. Some people think I don't care about the item and don't care if it gets sold. That is not true. It tears me up inside to think that my ancestors have taken such good care of the item (and my nephews' items) and they are being so disrespected. I imagine my poor relative in the trenches at such a young age fighting and eventually dying at war and my heart aches. I don't want the item to leave the family. \n\nI will do my best to answer as many questions as possible. Thank you all for your interest!", "Apologies in advance if this thread is a bit of a downer. This is a question I've been struggling with since I found out the extent of my condition, and it's honestly only gotten more stressful as time has gone on. By the way, please don't let my condition influence your judgement of me, I'm only including it here for context.\n\nI'm a 29 years old woman and was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. So let me take this opportunity to remind everyone to get a mole map done at some point, it most likely would have saved my life. Anyway my condition has only gotten worse and my chances of survival are 10% at best according to those treating me. I've basically been told that I should prepare everything now for when I (most likely) pass away.\n\nThis leads me to a difficult situation regarding my sister. We've never really gotten along well, mostly living separate lives, and we completely stopped talking to each other several years ago. My sister was responsible for breaking up my first marriage after she told his parents something about me that they didn't approve of. His parents threatened to excommunicate him if he didn't divorce me, and he did. I haven't spoken to her since.\n\nI've never forgiven her for this. And I never will forgive her. Ever.\n\nHowever, my mother, father, and brother - while understanding my resentment - all want me to forgive my sister. They say that what she did was despicable and I'm completely right to despise her, but that if I don't forgive her before I pass she'll never get closure. Supposedly (all of this I've heard through my parents), she has been racked with guilt ever since she found out about my condition. She wants to apologise and seek forgiveness but I haven't given her the chance.\n\nAs I said, I cannot and will never forgive her. This post is not about whether I should forgive her.\n\nThis post is whether I should pretend to forgive her so that she can have closure. This is what my mother wants me to do. As it stands now, I have no intention of giving her closure and feel she doesn't deserve it. My family thinks I'm being vindictive (they haven't said this harshly due to my situation, but they really want me to forgive her).\n\nEveryone in my family is extremely attached to this situation and I need some unbiased opinions here. So AITA for not wanting to give her closure?", "My wife and I are vacationing at the beach. We walked into a crab shack style restaurant today right on the beach to get some of that sweet sweet seafood. While we were waiting to be served after being seated a family was seated next to us. It was a grandma, grandpa, and grandson. Grandson was around 7-8 years old and was immediately crying and yelling at ear piercing volume at the grandparents about how he \u201ctold them that he didn\u2019t want to eat here!\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t even want to come to the beach!\u201d The doting grandmother was trying to console him and was basically serving as a whipping post. The grandfather was silently eating and not engaging.\n\nAt first we ignored him as best we could, but he got progressively louder and louder and was frankly ruining our lunch. I was wearing prescription sunglasses indoors because I left my glasses at our chair by accident and I needed them to see. I was looking at the drink menu that was in this small plastic stand on our table, and as I was the little kid loudly started accusing me of staring at him. Grandma politely asked me not to stare at him, and when I explained that I was reading the menu, she tried to explain to the kid in a \u201csee, it was just a misunderstanding\u201d type of way. The kid was having none of it and proceeded to accuse me of looking at him again about 5 minutes later.\n\nOnce he started accusing me of staring at him the second time. I started actually staring at him, and when he would have an outburst I would just move my gaze slightly somewhere else and play dumb. I\u2019m sure it was obvious what I was doing, but it was amusing, and it was tormenting this entitled turd. At one point, when grandma went to the bathroom and grandpa was still I engaged, the kid just turned in his seat and puffed up aggressively and said \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you to stop staring at me again!\u201d When he did that, I slid my sunglasses down my nose, winked at him over my glasses, and slid them back up, at which point he had a massive meltdown and asked his grandpa to make me stop. \n\nIn a solid and loud outburst Grandpa slammed his fist down on the table and unloaded on the kid about how he had done nothing but bitch for the last 3 hours, stood up, grabbed the kid by the collar and walked him up to the hostess and paid for their meal. Grandma came out of the bathroom shortly after and saw that they were leaving so she left with them. \n\nMy wife was angry that I had fucked with a little kid, despite his behavior. I defended myself, but she says that I wasn\u2019t THE asshole, but I was AN asshole. I maintain that I wasn\u2019t the asshole, though I did inadvertently ruin the lunch of the old folks he was with by spooling him up more than he already was. We\u2019re at an impasse, what\u2019s your verdict Reddit?\n\nEdit: my first gold! Holy shit, thanks Reddit.\n\nAND a platinum?! Awesome!\n\nNow a silver in the mix? Awesome! Thanks Reddit.\n\nAlso, some mid-vote reflection. Don\u2019t have long, we\u2019re still on vacation so I\u2019m updating this during my morning routine. One of the biggest lessons I\u2019ve learned from this AITA is to not gloss over details, because the premise of one of the points I\u2019ve heard a lot here is based on some things I was definitely not clear on. That\u2019s my bad, and I should have been more clear. Hindsight is 20/20, but you live and learn. Just to clarify a few points: \n\nWhile the kid was crying at the beginning when he came in, that was short lived, and was over well before I came into the picture. When I said things like \u201cmeltdown\u201d, they didn\u2019t involve tears, but anger and yelling. He was pounding his fists on the table, doing that exaggerated hand fold exhale, and yelling/screaming at his grandma. I wasn\u2019t sitting there reducing a child to a blubbering heap of tears and anguish, that would be horrifying and heartbreaking. Poking a very frustrated bear of a kid? Sure. Childishly making someone as uncomfortable as they were making everyone else? Absolutely. Torturing a helpless child into a lifetime of scars and fear? Hardly. That\u2019s partially my fault for using words like \u201ctorment\u201d. It was hyperbole and set the wrong tone. \n\nAlso, when I said, \u201c...accusing me of staring at him the second time. I started actually staring at him...\u201d I should have been more clear. I didn\u2019t just sit there and stare at a scared child who was just hoping the scary man would go away. I was eating lunch with my wife, she was my main focus. What was happening was the kid started to alternate between fixating on me and trying to get his grandma to do something or give him something. There were a lot of times over that two hours that he would stare at me and I either wouldn\u2019t notice because I was talking to my wife or I ignored it. Only periodically would I meet his gaze for 10 seconds or so, and then he would have another outburst about how I was looking at him. I\u2019m not trying to change votes or defend myself, I just wanted to clarify on a misconception I\u2019m seeing a lot in comments, and even more in personal messages. \n\nThe other point I should have been more clear on is the timescale in question. From being seated at our table to the other group getting up and leaving was less than 3 hours but more than 2.\n\nFinal edit:\n\nWell it appears I have been labeled the asshole. I stand by what I did, but accept the verdict. Many people voted YTA in a supporting manner, so I take it as a win all the same and feel some vindication.\n\nSome lessons were learned. From what I experienced, I do not believe in the slightest that the kid had anything mentally wrong with him, he was just being a brat. That being said, the thought never crossed my mind during the encounter. I\u2019d obviously never dream of taunting or negatively interacting with someone who was autistic. But, again, I have no reason to believe that he was.\n\nAlso, should I ever find myself in another AITA situation, I\u2019ll be sure to be as thorough in the description of the situation as possible. I think the outcome of the vote would have been different had I been more precise with my wording and less hyperbolic in my tone. \n\nThank you for the gold and platinum redditors, and the supportive messages. To those people who sent messages threatening to harm me, please stop. I\u2019m not interested in your 10 point plan to \u201cget me\u201d. Remember the words of wisdom from the AITA rules, one interaction does not an asshole make. We are all the asshole at some point.", "So my sister is 22 and has never been in a relationship. I'll be honest she's unattractive overweight and has no personality whatsoever. Despite all that she has a huge ego. She whines about being unable to find a relationship even tought there were men interested but she rejected them because her standards are too high she expects someone that will take care of their looks (she doesn't) someone who will focus on her and her only. Yesterday I snapped in the middle of her rant about how all men are the same and said to her that she isn't a great catch and should either take care of herself more and better herself or lower her standards because everyone around her is tired of her bitching, she stayed quiet and we didn't talk since.\n\n\nEdit : Some of my familiy members did try to explain the same thing to her a few times in a nicer manner but she always rolled her eyes and continued with the same \"men aren't shit\"\n\nAlso I didn't just assume she wants attractive buff men she stated it quite a few times saying that men have no reason to be fat unattractive and lazy\n\n\nI'm a female just for the INFO\n\n\nEdit 2 : I never said or tought that fat people are unattractive because they're fat or that they're unworthy etc. Fat people are people and they have the right to love themselves BUT I was just calling out the hypocrisy of my fat sister calling out and shaming men for being exactly that and thinking that fat man don't have the same value as fat women do my problem isn't my sister's weight but her mindset \n\n\ud83d\udea8 PLEASE STOP MAKING FAT JOKES AND HURTFULL COMMENTS TOWARDS FAT PEOPLE IT DOESN'T HELP THE SITUATION IT JUST MAKES IT WORSE \ud83d\udea8\n\nUPGRADE : I TOUGHT ABOUT MAKING A NEW POST FOR THIS BUT I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY SO...\nBasically I went to my sister's room and said that what I said was too harsh  and that I'm sorry and she replied telling me it was whatever and to get out of her room so I guess that's it idk what else I should say thank you all for commenting and sharing your opinions with me cheers\n\nEdit 4 : k I swear this is the last one I just wanted to apologise for my bad grammar English isn't my firt language and since someone crossposted my post I kindly ask anyone that's about to do so too to dm me ahead thanks", "My son is on Reddit daily and will recognize my post immediately, so a throwaway would be pointless.  Will still try to keep identifying details out to maintain his privacy from his friends.\n\nMy son graduated HS in 2012.  He spent that first year working full time in a warehouse with a particularly demanding boss.  He learned a lot about the workforce and developed an amazing work ethic.  But he quickly realized that he wanted to obtain his college degree so he started community college part time.  About a year later he got an apartment with his then girlfriend.  He still was going to college and working.  After a year he wanted to come home so that he could go to school full time, work part time and finish school quicker.  This is where things go downhill. \n \nWe were happy to have him come home and concentrate on school.  We told him that we'd pay his car insurance and phone but he would be responsible for his car payment.  We also stressed that he would have to help out around the house in lieu of rent/utilities.  He would be responsible for cleaning his bathroom every other week, helping with dishes, trash, and vacuum once a week.  Suffice to say, he barely did anything.  It caused a lot of tension in my marriage.  We had many sit down convos with him, it would get better for a week, then right back how it was.  \n\nFastforward to last summer...he's been dating a really great girl who we like and they made plans to go to a university out of state starting Jan 2019.  Her home situation was very stressful, she already put in 2 years at community college and 1 semester at a very hard local university, and she has a great work ethic also.  So we decide to offer for her to stay with us until they go.  Within 2 weeks of her moving in the plan changed from leaving in Jan to leaving in August!  Not what we signed up for.  We have a sit down convo and they want to save up more money before they go, she's going to work 2 jobs, they need more time to find and apt, etc.  So we all compromise and decide June 1st will be the move out date. \n \nFastforward to Dec and I'm about to lose my mind.  Our son barely does anything at all.  He might clean the bathroom every 6wks, he might put dishes away every 2wks, virtually nothing.  She has cleaned the bathroom twice since Sept.  That's it.  \nI was over it.  The day after Xmas, I sat him down and told him he had to pay me $100/mo cleaning fee and they had to be out by Apr 1st.  I told him I was starting to resent him for not helping, that I've taught him everything I can as a parent, that I'll always love him, but it's better for our relationship if he goes sooner rather than later.  He was livid.  He's barely spoken to me since.  \n\nI feel like I made the right decision as a parent because it really felt like enabling at this point.  But I also feel horrible because maybe I'm being too hard and expecting too much?  I just know that I love him and my heart is breaking.\n\nTl,Dr: kicking my son out for acting entitled\n\nEdit: Our son has been out of school since last May. It was at that time that he bumped up his hours at work to full time. Also, when I gave him the Apr 1st move out date, I specifically told him that if anything came up financially that we would help him...as long as it wasn't a repeating occurrence. IE, we would pay his insurance, but no cash would be given.\n\nThank you for all of the responses. The reason for my post was to get an honest assessment of the situation from a group of his peers. It's going to be an emotional couple of days and y'all have helped me sort out my feelings in a good way. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit 2: For those wondering about his mental health, I can't say for sure obviously, but I don't believe his dirtiness is because of depression/anxiety. He's always been messy. Before his GF moved in I could tell him to clean it up when it got to a certain point. (His door has always had to stay shut so guests couldn't see.) But now that she's living in there too, I'm over it. \n\nAnd of course he was raised with chores and held accountable. But he's also one of those people who doesn't care about the consequence. But I'm strong willed too. There were times that all he had in his room was a bed and his clothes, not even a door. I believe everything besides food, clothing, and shelter are privileges.  Privileges that can be lost. But nothing I ever did changed his behavior. He is who he is. He's charming, sarcastic, incredibly smart, compassionate and he's also a world class procrastinator, stubborn, he lies to us and he's lazy in his personal life. \n\nHope this helps clear up some questions. I'm amazed at how many of you went through similar situations, but you all seem to have done so well. Thank you for sharing. It means more than you'll ever know.", "This is a new situation for me, and I can't find anything like it anywhere. I come from a community where infertility is very common. My adoptive parents couldn't get pregnant and adopted me. My husband's parents adopted him and his brother after they couldn't get pregnant. My adoptive mother's two sisters also couldn't have children, nor could my adoptive father's adoptive mother. My biological mother and my adoptive mother's parents have passed. I do not know of anyone in my immediate or close extended family who has ever had a biological child.\n\nI got married, and I was so much expecting problems that I was shocked to get pregnant. I'm in the second trimester, and things are going routinely. To emphasize the main 'thing' here is that **I am the first woman in two generations to have a pregnancy in living memory**.\n\nNaturally, I try to be sensitive but apparently I'm \"milking\" it by complaining of my various (normal) illnesses and problems. They say that I'm making it up and that it's not that bad. After months of this from everyone, I ended up blowing up at a family dinner and asking a room full of barren women how the hell they would know how bad I was feeling and WHAT pregnancy even feels like. Multiple people started crying and my husband took me home. I feel bad but honestly they need to take a class on it or at least get off my back.\n\nAITA here?", "I was walking home from school about two weeks ago when I noticed two kids in my neighboorhood shooting at a dog with an airsoft gun. The dog was trapped in a garden where the owner of the dog had set up a small fence around so the dog could run free, but not escape.\n\nThese kids kept shooting at the dog, so I told them to stop. As these were two bratty, maybe 10-13 year old kids they just laughed at me and kept shooting. I then walked up to the kid and grabbed his gun and he got scared and promised not to do it anymore.\n\nHowever when I was walking home again the other day I found the same kids shooting at the same dog again. I therefor got mad and walked up the kids and grabbed his gun again. However this time he just laughed and asked me what I was going to do about it. So I threw his plastic gun into a stone wall nearby and I am pretty sure I broke the thing for good.\n\nEdit1: Here\u2019s an update. As I said in a reply to one of the comments, I have contacted the owner of the dog. However he is very old and doesnt want to do much, probably because he is too tired.\nAlso I have not seen the kids, but if I ever see them do anything I will find their parents this time.", "It\u2019s aryan.  \n \nNot arian.

When I open the door, I see the driver and it's obvious some of the wood of our fence went through the windshield and severed part of the guy's neck and the guy is dead. I call 911 and I then retreat to my front porch to watch all of the emergency workers deal with the accident while I sob uncontrollably.  I didn't sleep at all that first night.\n\nA couple days later, I get a knock on my door. I answer it and there are the three adult children of the man who died in the accident.  They explain that they believe their dad probably had a heart attack and ran off the road because he had a previous heart condition. I listened as sympathetically as I could but I started feeling sick and the visions of this man come flooding back to me. \n\nThat's about the time one of the daughters ask me if I removed the gold chain from his neck since I was the first person to get to him. I explained that I would do no such thing but that it was possible it was torn off by the post that went through the windshield and hit his neck. I left out the gory details that their dad was nearly decapitated by the post. \n\nThey asked if they could search my yard for the chain and I said yes. They looked for about a half hour and then came back up to the house with no luck. They asked me if I planned on filing a claim against their dad's insurance for the fence his truck destroyed. I was completely mortified by the question but quickly said I doubted it because I just wanted this all behind me and it was just a fence. \n\nBefore they leave, they ask me if they can place a wreath in my yard in the spot where their dad died. I'm completely mortified but I replied that I would rather them not since that's my private property and I don't want to be reminded of what happened there. They get upset at my answer and tell me I'm being unreasonable. I reiterate that I don't want any wreaths in my yard and tell them I need to handle some things so that they would leave\n\nWhen my husband gets home he says that I was being unreasonable and that these people just wanted to grieve in their way. I stood my ground and explained that this was all a traumatic experience for me and I want it over.\n\nThe next day we get up and discover that they placed a wreath in our yard anyway.  I absolutely become infuriated and go down to remove the wreath. My husband tells me that it's there and I should just leave it, but I really didn't want a reminder of what happened there. \n\nOverall, they placed four wreaths and I removed each one.

The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\nEdit: Could I have given him more points? Sure. Why did I give him a 7? Just to make sure that the other judges wouldn't make him win. \n\nEdit2: Damn, so many of you 'calling me out' for making this up. Well I don't know what to tell you, I have just had terrible luck my entire life. I feel like I'm living Larry David from Curb Your Enthusiasm's life. Believe me, don't believe me, I don't care. I'm currently sitting (ironically) on a curb because my scooter broke down on my way to an important presentation and there is no place to park so I have to wait till they come tow it to the garage before I can uber to school. ", "A couple months ago I was having a big family dinner (my family + my wife's family). My siblings and I began reminiscing and the topic got to my first daughter that passed away. For whatever reason my step-daughter (20 years old) began to chime in. I should mention that my step-daughter and I have never gotten along, but I've always tried to accomodate her and make her feel loved. The hostility is solely on her part. Her mother and I have been married 5 years.\n\nShe told me that I shouldn't talk about my daughter fondly when I'm responsible for her death. Her reasoning is that since my daughter caught SARS from me that I'm responsible, which I don't think is fair at all. Anyone that lived through the SARS outbreak knew how hectic it was here.\n\nI don't know where this was coming from because I've obviously talked fondly about my first daughter in the past and she hasn't said a thing. I demanded she apologize, and when she refused and her mother didn't back me up, I left to stay the night at my brother's house. The following day she only doubled down and would reaffirm it was my fault whenever I asked her to apologise and take it back.\n\nAfter about a month of constant arguments over this I decided to kick her out and gave her 2 months to find a place to stay. This is a level of disrespect that's unforgivable at 20 years old. My wife doesn't want me to, but I've overruled her since she let this go on for a month without ever reprimanding her daughter. The house is mine (a premarital asset) and this is the only time I've played that card.\n\nAITA?\n\nAsking because obviously my wife thinks so.", "I'm almost 70 years old, my daughter is in her late 20s. I had to adopt her as I have never been able to get pregnant myself. While my daughter is married and graduated college, she is not... mentally healthy. That's just the truth.\n\nShe was a deeply disturbed child. Always unhappy, always on the edge of freaking out. I tried to help, but she never wanted to hear it. She displayed some distressing traits, but not regularly enough to get it reported. She could never focus on anything and still can't. I am shocked that none of the places she's lived in her adult life have ever burned down, because she frequently started fires as a child out of negligence.\n\nShe has always rushed for substances to cope with anything unpleasant in life. As a teenager, I had a suspicion that she was abusing cough syrup, but was never able to prove it. She has always drank too much. I'm sorry, but when you're regularly drinking entire bottles of wine and daily need a shot of liquor to \"fall asleep\", you have a problem. But she was \"doing well in school\" and then \"had a good job\" so I wasn't able to comment. I know now that she's likely just a functional alcoholic. She's always flirted with Xanax, but was never given a regular prescription.\n\nShe always wanted children. After getting married, she actually did stop with the drugs and alcohol and got pregnant three years in. She lost the baby fairly late stage (18w). I hate to say it, but that's for the best. She and her equally...not well husband held a funeral for the child, which I of course attended. \n\nThey were devastated, and for health reasons had a full year wait to try again. The year has passed and they're having the same difficulties and more. Her husband, my son in law, is a frequent flyer in the psych ward for depression issues. She's gone back to previous drinking and now takes Xanax on a daily basis. Her old medical issues that forced her on the pill are back. \n\nShe is in therapy that clearly doesn't work and is always in hysterics about it. I'm sorry, but objectively, this is for the best. I'd rather go to a funeral a month for the same dead child than subject a living one to a life with these two as parents, with the high chance of inheriting it themselves.\n\nShe wants to still be called a mother, which people oblige her in. I told her honestly that she needs to get herself and her partner in order before she should even think of getting pregnant and that a woman popping pills every day and washing it down with alcohol is in no way a fit parent. I'm apparently the asshole and \"don't understand pain\". Am I really the monster here?", "For the record, I have nothing against people who are asexual. What two consenting adults do, or don't do, is none of my business & I honestly couldn't care less, but I don't think I could live that life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few years ago, I dated a girl and from the start I knew sex wasn't going to be a big part of the relationship, early on. She was a young Christian girl (I was young as well, don't worry), so I figured things wouldn't be very sexually-driven, and I was more than willing to wait as long as she wanted; she had a wonderful personality, it's one of the main reasons I was attracted to her\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, we had a conversation about sex, and she revealed to me that she was asexual, with no intent on having sex, ever, even talking about adopting as opposed to doing the dance with no pants (as she did want kids). So this made me somewhat uncomfortable, as I'm not completely sure if a relationship like that would work for me. So I ended up ending the relationship. However, after doing so, I got practically attacked by a mutual friend, calling me an asshole and various other nasty things. I've honestly been questioning this for a while, and I'm curious what the internet says about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: HOLY FUCK this post blew up. Okay, so, a few clarifications:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor our ages: I had graduated the spring before we got together (we got together in the summer) and she was a (rising) senior in HS. We had started talking when I was still in school but it took me a little bit too long to grow a pair and actually ask her out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the length of the relationship: About half a year, a little bit more than.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for my relationship status with the friend: Oh no I definitely dropped all contact with her after that shit. Tbh, she had always been more friendly with my ex than with me, it wasn't a huge surprise. When it came to our friend group, my ex was the popular one, so when we broke up I lost contact with a lot of them & only one of them actually said something outright to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the actual breaking up itself: The entire conversation was done over text, and while I wasn't as soft as I probably could have been, I don't think I was an outright dick to her or anything. I was a stupid kid, but not a malicious one; any assholishness in the actual text itself was unintentional, because I was (and still am) very bad at talking to people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the people saying that we could have talked about an open relationship or something along those lines: She would have shut that down in an instant, and honestly I don't think I'd want one anyway. I'm not one for polyamorous relationships; but then again I've never tried it and they always say don't knock it 'till you've tried it, lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the people calling her an asshole for not volunteering the information: Honestly? I'm not sure if she even knew the term for it; she didn't outright use the term \"asexual\" until we started having the conversation & even that wasn't until I asked her outright and told her the definition of the term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "Not sure the title fits, couldn't think of something better.\n\nMy stepsister(18) was asked to give a talk at an autism conference kinda thing, and I talked to one of the organizers and let her know that I was uncomfortable with this decision as my stepsister was planning to just advertise her book in her talk, which is essentially about \"the hardship of growing up as the sister of an autistic child\", which I find inappropriate and insulting. As a result, my stepsister was asked to step down. Now my family is livid at me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am all for advocating the struggles of the left-out siblings,  and their voices need to be heard. But my stepsister is flat-out lying about her experience, which doesn't sit well with me.\n\nI was diagnosed as on the spectrum in my childhood, but found the diagnosis to be virtually irrelevant later in life. I rarely let people know about it, and nobody has ever suspected I could be autistic. My parents divorced about 5 years ago, and my father remarried quickly after. So when I met my stepsister for the first time, she was 13 and I was 20. We are not close at all, and I am not close to my father. We never lived together. We only saw each other a handful of times in the previous years, only for a few hours at a time. I tried to bond with her initially, but she wouldn't shut up about how \"crazy\" I was and how strange it was for her to know somebody with autism. She compared being autistic to being a serial killer and all that fun. My father is an a-hole, so she undoubtedly got that from him. I didn't blame her, but stayed distant after I realised that her weird fascination with my \"craziness\" didn't lessen as she grew older. She kept telling me that she wanted to become a therapist to \"help people like me live a good life\".\n\nLast month, my father let me know that she was publishing her first book. On autism.  He was incredibly proud of her accomplishment and told me how she wanted to give a talk about it at a conference, to \"reach the right audience and give expert advise based on first hand experience\". I thought it was a joke at first. When I found out it wasn't, I was horrified and finally decided to talk to the organizers of the conference, after all attempts at talking to stepsister failed.\n\nI tried to be nice about it; I didn't want to come out and be like \"hey she's a fraud and full of bullshit\", so I worded it carefully, something along the lines of \"I'm uncomfortable about my stepsister using me as a reference in her book, as I don't agree with some of her points and fear that the audience would take offense.\" The decision to ask my stepsister to not speak was not made by me.\n\nTo be clear: the book is all about her, whining about how hard life is when you have a \"mentally ill\" sister, and how hard it is to cope. It's complete fiction, save for the fact that she's clearly referencing me as the sister throughout.\n\nMy family is now mad at me, even my mother (who hates my father and his new family) says it was wrong of me to talk to the organizers. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I barely know my stepsister. She did not grow up with me.", "I have been with my SO for about 8 years.  We live together, have several kids, and for all practical purposes are a married couple.  For personal reasons though we decided marriage is not the best route for us at the time and are still just partners.  My parents refuse to let us share a bed or room when we visit their house, so for the last 5 years we have never visited for more than a day.  My parents recently moved across the country and are having a huge family party to celebrate their 30th anniversary.  \n\nI was talking to my mom about plans and she said my sister and her newly wed would be sharing one guest room, my kids could have the other guest room, my partner could have the couch and I could sleep on the futon in their bedroom.  I told them that it would work better if the kids slept on the couch and floor downstairs and me and my partner could share the bedroom.\n\nMy mom said that wouldn't work.  I knew why, but said why not.  She said well you're not married of course.  I hate to make their special weekend about me but I had to retort that we would not be staying with them if they would not let us share a room while allowing my sister to share a room with her husband.  I said it also further adds salt to the wound because it delegitmizes our relationship to my kids.  (7,4,2).  My mom said I was being selfish and it disturbed her that I would expect to sleep in her house with another person while unmarried.   Money is not a issue so I said well we will be staying in a hotel or not coming at all and I hanged up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "I've been with my girlfriend for nearly two years. I'm 48, she's 49, and she has a 19 year old daughter. I began living with them all pretty early on, only six months in.\n\nI learned relatively quickly it's a rough household. My girlfriend is exceedingly controlling of her daughter. Not allowed out, not allowed to have a job, not allowed a cellphone. She doesn't protest because she can't go anywhere else. It's either live by mommy's rules or be homeless to be frank. There's no abuse other than mental/emotional, just so I'm clear. She's all peachy keen when my son (17) comes over, it's like she's a different person. She's a good \"stepmom\" to my son but an abysmal mother to her own.\n\nI kind of took a passive approach to this. I didn't interfere because she's not my child. She wasn't too friendly with me early on but she's grown to like me enough to open up about these things. At this point two years in, we're very close. She even calls me \"dad\" which struck me as odd but she never had any father in her life, at least not this long.\n\nI think the turning point for me was when we decided to bring a puppy into the home. I grew up with lapdogs who roamed free throughout the house, but she decided this dog would stay in a cage for 18-20 hours a day and only let out to eat and mess outside. Despite my protests and attempts to let her roam free, my girlfriend eventually put a key lock on her cage. We became very distant after this.\n\nThe daughter proposed to me that we all leave this relationship. She's an adult and wants to make this decision to flee her mother. She wanted my help because she can't otherwise. I was going to leave my girlfriend anyways over the treatment of the dog. I can afford a good 3bdr apartment, easy, so a +1 I think could be a good idea. This could also be her only way of escape. My plan was to have an apartment with my son and dog, but the addition of stepdaughter wouldn't hurt.\n\nAm I the asshole for effectively stealing away my girlfriend's daughter to live with me?\n\n[More info](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c061nc/wibta_for_running_off_with_my_gfs_daughter_and_dog/er3usn1/)", "My wife and I hired a photographer for our wedding for $2,000, and we were eagerly awaiting our photos. Fairly recently I was contacted by the photographer, apologizing profusely, and telling me he\u2019s not going to be able to get us the photos due to a fire that ravaged his entire house.\n\nI snooped on his social media profiles to double-check that this was true and not just an excuse, and it is; he posted pictures of the burnt-down house. He also posted that he has homeowner\u2019s insurance that will cover it, and has posted some pics of him staying at his sister\u2019s, so fortunately he isn\u2019t on the street or totally screwed. Still a pretty shitty situation, though.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch, though: he\u2019s only offering us a 90% refund ($1800) instead of the full $2000 one. He says the differential is due to the \u201chuge amount of time he put into editing, the 5 hours he spent shooting at the wedding, and the hour-and-a-half round trip he drove to shoot.\u201d So that\u2019s $200 we\u2019re out.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to sound too selfish or entitled, but while I think it\u2019s all well and good he put all that work into it, all that doesn\u2019t really benefit us if we\u2019re not getting a single photo out of it, and I don\u2019t see why we owe him anything. It\u2019s sad and not his fault (IDK, maybe he could have saved an extra hard drive somewhere not his house), but we\u2019re not getting our long-awaited & treasured pics, and I feel we deserve the full refund.\n\nI\u2019ve demanded the full refund, and he\u2019s stood very firm that he\u2019s only giving the 90% one.

Last semester, he took a \"business law\" class for business students (this is relevant). \n\nA few months ago, I stopped providing real answers when my husband would ask me about how work was going or if I had anything exciting come up.  He's always had a tendency to try to tell me how to resolve situations at work, which is super annoying because he has no idea what he's talking about, but it's gotten so much worse since he took this stupid business law class.  He now thinks that he is an expert on law and lectures me about it.  I wasn't even telling him detailed stuff about my cases.  Our conversations would go like this:\n\n>Me: I have to go to court tomorrow.  \n>  \n>Him: State court or federal court?  \n>  \n>Me: State court.  \n>  \n>Him: Why don't you remove the case to federal court?

It turns out, he has been failing and dropping lots of classes. He always told my wife and I that his grades are fine and that his GPA is okay. The only access we had to his school account was to make tuition payments. We even paid for a more expensive school because he really wanted to go there. His sister also went to this school and had a great experience so we were okay with it. \n\nHe came home this summer and told us the truth. He had been on academic alert since his first semester for failing a class. However, his GPA was still okay because his other classes pulled up the F. Overtime, he started failing and dropping more classes and his GPA went down more and more until he hit probation. He was suspended for failing to bring his GPA above a 2.0. Apparently he appealed the decision and the dean told him he could have one more chance instead of taking an involuntary year off but he would be dismissed from the school if he failed anymore classes. Well lo and behold, he failed another class and was kicked out. He then had no choice but to come clean to us.\n\nWe have spent around $28,000 a year ($18,000 tuition + $10,000 dorm/food, not including the spending money we gave him every month). We spent $84,000 for him to only come out of that school with 34 credits. We did this because both of us graduated college with huge student loan debts and we wanted him to enter his career with no debt. \n\nHe applied to another school as soon as he found out he was suspended and got accepted. However, I told him I would not be paying anymore tuition, and that he would need to take out federal loans (and that we would not be cosigning on any private loans). I eventually relented and came up with an idea. I said he could earn my trust back by going to community college for a semester or two (which we would pay for). If he passed all of his classes, then we could pay for his other university on a semester-by-semester basis and we would need to see his grades online every term. I also said he would need to go see someone at school to figure out what bad habits or learning issues led him to this point and to help him avoid it from here on out. If he felt like he needed any kind of therapy, we would cover that too. \n\nWell my son absolutley hates the idea of going to community college.

I've been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. \n\nWhen the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. I then asked the waitress, \"Does the Guac have onions?\" To which she responded, \"Yes, it does\".  I then proceeded to tell her, \"I have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?\" I told her I have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. After the waitress left, my date asked me, \"are you really allergic?\" To which I said \"no :D, but this way, we get fresh guac\". She was pretty impressed like \"damn, I'm stealing this one\". When the guac came in, I asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. \n\nThe rest of the date went well. We ordered some drinks first and then food later. What I forgot to do when I was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. When I got my dish, I took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! She thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. I didnt know how to react so I just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. Her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so I tell him that I forgot to mention not to put onions and that I have a severe allergy. \n\nThe first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  \n\n(Side note: I don't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. I have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but I know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, I thought it makes you cough a lot, I don't know why I thought that.) \n\nCutscene to now: I start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. I tell him, \"I barely got any onions in the bite\". My date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. I told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that I'm okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. I asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (Not like we ate anyway) but I still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. \n\nAfter leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. I shot my shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. Now it is important to note that the bus stop where I grab my bus to go home is RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RESTAURANT. I'm sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on Reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. He thinks that I am taking the bus to the emergency room.  \n\nHe kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. He felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. I finally gave up and told him , \"Okay\". In my head, I thought I'd just let him drop me there and then I'll take an uber back home. However, we get there AND HE WANTS TO COME IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK.  I'm like hey man, trust me, IM OKAY. Nothing is going to happen to me. You can leave. It was so awkward. We were parked and he kept asking if I'm sure and I'm like yes I'm sure don't worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. \n\nAt the end he said he'd just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. We walk in the emergency room and I'm the only person there. Great. I had to walk to the nurse and tell her that I might be having a slight allergic reaction. Supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and I'm like yes, everything is going to be okay. \"Thank you so much for everything.\" He gives me his number and tells me to inform him once I'm out. \n\nHere I am. A healthy 25 year old adult. Having to pay $500 to visit a fucking emergency room for no fucking reason: http://imgur.com/tfU3k5g\nAnother nurse came up to me to take my vitals and the doctor asked what was wrong and I had to sheepishly tell him, \"I think I might have been having an allergic reaction\". He says, \"Are you allergic to anything?\" And I go \"No\". \n\nHe gave me a benadryl and sent me out. I then spent another $25 to Uber home. I told what happened to my friend and she said I was the worst kind of asshole. I learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy, but I don't think I was an asshole because I did try to avoid as much confrontation as possible, and even ensured the waitress and supervisor that it was all my fault. Sorry for the long text, but AITA? \n\n", "The title is a bit more straight forward than it really is.\n\nI have known my buddy since middle school (we are 35 now) and he has always been a serial cheater. Over the past about year or so he has been hooking up with his secretary. I have known about it the whole time (he likes to brag). Up to this point I have never told his wife (or any of his previous GFs when he was cheating on them), it was just one of those things where I said, \"not my life, not my problem\"\n\nWell last night we got into an argument while we were at a local brewery. It started to escalate and he started throwing in some low blows that really pissed me off. So purely out of anger I say, \"At least I am not banging the secretary behind my wife's back!\" while his wife was sitting right next to him.\n\nTelling someone they are being cheated on=not asshole move. but does the context change that?\n\nEDIT: Since alot old people have asked. I brought it up when he put me and my wife on blast for infertility.\n\nEDIT2: He apparently admitted to the cheating at she took off to stay with her sister. Me and my buddy have appologized to each other but I kinda doubt this friendship will survive. I appologized to his wife, she thanked me for coming clean. He appologized to my wife and she told him to fuck off.\n\nEDIT3: Now getting comments from strangers saying they are glad me and my wife (who is now reading these) can't have kids.", "  \n\nSo I have a pretty tight group of friends that have all been together r since elementary school. All early 30s now. Lately with people getting married and our careers we haven\u2019t had much time to spend together. So one of my friends suggested a long overdue guy\u2019s night. Just pizza and beers and catching up at a buddy\u2019s place. I said that I would order and pay for the pizza from our usual spot.\n\nSo the day of guy\u2019s night, I get a text from the host\u2019s wife (We\u2019ll call her Kim), asking me to pick up some pizza on the other end of the city. At first I was confused and then I found out that she basically just cancelled her plans with her girlfriends to interject herself into our guy\u2019s night. I told her that the place she wants to pick up from is on the other end of the city, plus we already had a place to order from. Kim had wanted to order a bunch of these super expensive, tiny thin-crust hipster pizzas. I tell Kim that we\u2019re a bunch of dudes that just want some regular filling pepperoni pizza to eat while we have a few drinks. The host texts me after to just say, \u201cYeah, go ahead and just get the regular, its way easier.\u201d So we go ahead and order the regular stuff. While I\u2019m driving to his place, I get a message form Kim that reads something like the following:\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re being really selfish here. I wanted to share something with you guys that I found amazing and have a new experience with you, but you decided that you just have to make this all about yourself. You know that Host isn\u2019t going to say no to anyone and you\u2019re just being mean to get your way.\u201d\n\nI told Kim , \u201cJust cancel the order, get whatever you want. I\u2019m out\u201d and turned around and drove back home. To clarify, I wasn\u2019t upset about not getting my choice of food, but at the fact that Kim not only invited herself to what she knew was a guy\u2019s night and then started making demands about food for us and telling me to pick up the food that she wants when she was also off of work at this time. Kim is a bit of a spoiled princess that\u2019s used to getting everything she wants.\n\nSo I decided not to go, because if she was already getting this upset over something like pizza, then I don\u2019t want to spend one of my nights off around her. None of the guys were upset, they wanted me to come but understood why I bailed. One last thing is we all hang our pretty regularly as a group anyways. So Kim sees us all once every week or so anyways. It's not that the guy's never get to see each-other, but we just haven't had a guy's only night in nearly a year.\n\nAm I The Asshole for not just going along with this to have a peaceful evening?", "The other night I went out to a bar with some buddies of mine. This was my first time visiting this bar. When I gave the bartender my driver\u2019s license as ID he confiscated it, stating that he doesn\u2019t think the person in the picture looks like me.\n\nIt is an older photo of me. I went on a diet and am now about 30 pounds slimmer than I was in the picture, and no longer have the prominent moustache that I do in the photo. Additionally, for whatever reason (lighting maybe), I look a bit darker/tanner and more Hispanic (I\u2019m half) in my ID photo than I usually appear. But since my diet/moustache shaving, I\u2019ve used that exact ID literally *hundreds* of times with no problem. Somehow, everyone prior has had the facial recognition to connect the man in the ID photo and myself. What\u2019s this guy\u2019s problem?\n\nI argued with the bartender for a long time, but he stood his ground and refused to give it back. As my friends drank their beers, I (who am personally very active on social media) made a Facebook post and a Tweet about the incident, telling people how they stole my driver\u2019s license, warning people not to go there, and calling them a \u201cshady shithole.\u201d In both of my posts, I tagged the bar\u2019s official Facebook page/Twitter handle so that when people search for the bar, my posts will pop up first thing.\n\nI asked for the manager, and he sided with the bartender. I continued arguing, and told him about the posts. Finally, I gave the manager an ultimatum: if give me my ID back, I will delete my posts ASAP, will leave, and will put this incident and the drama associated with it 100% in the past. \u201cI swear, give my ID back and it\u2019ll be over. No hard feelings. I\u2019ll be out of your hair.\u201d I showed him on my phone the number of responses/likes I\u2019d already received, emphasized how much it could damage his business.\n\nEventually, he sighed and conceded. \u201cIf you promise you\u2019ll get rid of those posts, and this whole thing is going to be over, then fine.\u201d I reaffirmed my promise, and he gave me back my ID finally, and apologized for what he said was \u201can unfortunate misunderstanding.\u201d I could tell that he still didn\u2019t believe my ID was legit, but didn\u2019t want his bar to receive too much negative publicity online.\n\nI didn\u2019t delete my posts, though. By the time I woke up the next morning, they\u2019d received a ton more attention, and I saw I\u2019d received a private message on Facebook from the company\u2019s page. \u201cHey there, bud,\u201d it read. \u201cRemember our agreement? You promised you\u2019d remove these posts. I got you your ID back and we\u2019re sorry about the incident, can you please make sure we put this in the past as we agreed upon?\u201d\n\nI responded to his message, \u201cFuck you,\u201d and blocked him immediately afterwards. After that, I typed up a formal complaint about the incident and sent it to his chain manager (it\u2019s part of a chain of 3 bars in my state). Was I an asshole for this?", "I am an American who has lived in the US her whole life. My parents are from India, and the 2 main languages they speak are Gujarati and Hindi. They have been US citizens for over 50 years now and safe to say we are proud to be Americans, and love our country. \n\nMy ex is American with Dutch ancestry & he only speaks English. I was with him for 1.5 years, before I unexpectedly fell pregnant (my BC failed) and my parents found out pretty much straight away because nosy Indian parents will find a way to know everything. \n\nThe outpouring of love and support from my 2 old folks was tremendous and they were staunchly on my side and babies side especially because when I told my ex I was pregnant he bailed and went MIA for 3 entire years (he still paid CS) the rest of the Indian community basically shunned me and called me a whore but my parents stuck by me. \n\nI moved back with my parents and they added an entire wing to their home just for me and my baby. They speak only Gujarati at home, as my parents have multiple businesses in India, and they prefer it. My mom and dad only speak to my kid in Gujarati and asked that I make sure she knows her heritage and her home. \n\nI spoke with a child psychologist who told me it is absolutely healthy and okay for her development if I speak minimal English with her at home, because she\u2019s exposed to so much American culture via external sources / tv and I speak English when I\u2019m around others including with her when we are out and about. \n\nMy ex came back into my life when my daughter was 3 because he had a change of heart and wanted to meet his daughter. He has fallen head over heels in love with her and begrudgingly I have to say he is a fantastic father and my daughter absolutely loves him. She\u2019s 6 now and the two both look exactly the same as well as act exactly the same- he is very charismatic and silly and he has taught her those qualities because I\u2019m pretty boring and serious and she has really opened up in a way I\u2019m proud to see. \n\nHis only \u2018complaint\u2019 is that she babbles to herself in Gujarati ALL the time and my ex hates it. He also feels that I\u2019m delaying her development by strictly speaking in Gujarati when I\u2019m at home and that it\u2019s un-American of me. He has also expressed dissatisfaction that he can\u2019t understand her and that he\u2019s missing out on sweet moments because sometimes she can\u2019t translate into English. She can speak English perfectly but she seems more confident in Gujarati, which I myself have noticed. \n\nI told him that he can either learn Gujarati or put up with our daughter being more comfortable in Gujarati. He thinks I\u2019m being difficult on purpose but I really don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing anything wrong.", "So me and my girlfriend have been together for 3 years and we both loved thia cartoon called \"Steven Universe\". Although it's a cartoon it gets really deep sometimes. \n\nSo on an episode there was a song called \"Here Comes a Thought\" and it became our song especially the part that goes \"Take a moment to think of just flexibility, love, and trust\". It was sung by the character that represents a strong relationship by fusion. (Would take to long to explain what this relationship is and why it's strong and what fusion is.)\n\nSo I thought about a ring that represented what that character stood for. I had the ring custom made The ring had 3 gems a ruby, sapphire, and amethyst. (I didn't know garnet could come in purple, I didn't get the show wrong, shut up about it)  Red and blue, and purple to show the connection of the two.\n\nSo when I proposed at first she was so excited and she said yes on her way home we started talking about the ring.\n\nFirst she said \"I love it but why did you choose it.\"\n\nI explained it to her and she said\n\n\"So you bought me a ring based of a cartoon\"\n\nI was shocked by this we had always watched the show together and loved the song I mentioned earlier. I thought that instead of getting some bland expensive clear rock I would get something that meant something, or so I thought. \n\nI asked her \"But I thought you loved the show, it always meant more to us than just another tv program.\"\n\nShe said \"yah but why would you buy something so important based off it\"\n\nOnce we got home I had to go on a drive only and think. \n\nSo am i the asshole for buying a ring based off a kid's show.\n\n\nEdit: Alright so we talked about the ring then we talked more about life and what we would do after getting married. This made of realize we're not ready to be married. That we both need time to ourselves. So... we broke up. Not because of the ring but because we realized we weren't for each. I know that kind of came out left field but that's what it is.", "I am fully prepared that I\u2019ll be called the asshole on this, but just for my own peace of mind I want to write my story up and hopefully make some sense of this. \n\nI met my husband 13 years ago. We were married after two years of being together. When I first met him, he told me that he had a 2 year old daughter that he had no interest in being a father to, and that she wasn\u2019t a planned baby. \n\nI accepted this, and accepted that he just paid child support and that was it. His child lives with her mom in Pasadena, and we live in Vermont- so as you can imagine, worlds away. \n\nMy husband never once expressed an interest in going to see his child, maintaining contact, they NEVER spoke or exchanged birthday cards, Christmas cards, etc. My husband said that he never had any intention to be a dad, and that this child was born despite his pleas for abortion. \n\nI accepted this because I myself am childfree- my childhood was spent slaving away looking after my mother\u2019s 5 other children, and while she was constantly on drugs it fell on me to be mom. I am NOT okay with children, having children, or wanting to foster maternal bonds with children. \n\nWhen I entered into this relationship, it was 100% done under the trust that my husband had no contact with this child or wanted to be a father.\n\nLast year, his daughter made a Facebook account and reached out to him. She spilled her heart out, said she had sleuthed her way into finding her father, she wanted a relationship desperately, etc. \n\nMy husband came to me in turmoil and in tears asked for permission to go and see her. I was angry, my world had turned upside down, my own place in his world had now changed, everything was different- but I swallowed my hurt and NEVER ONCE did I let him feel my own fear. I told him to go and make his peace. \n\nSince then he has regularly flown to see her. He has had an apparent complete change of heart and has taken on the role of daddy with enthusiasm and gusto, to the delight of both his daughter and her mother. \n\nA few weeks ago, he sat down and had a serious talk with me- he said he knew my stance on children, but he begged me to integrate this child into my life, to let her come and stay with us from time to time, to open my heart to her. I told him I couldn\u2019t do that. I said I would rather divorce then be a stepparent to a child I never knew would be in my life. \n\nTo be clear- i honestly 100% know for certain that they had never communication since before last year. Had I known, I would have left as it\u2019s unfair to this child, she only has 1 father whereas I can go and find another partner. I feel horrible. I feel like a terrible person, like I\u2019m an evil witch, but I also feel like this is horribly unfair to *me* - any insights on if my behavior is asshole-like would be very much appreciated.\n\nEDIT: my husband asked me to take on being a \u2018mom\u2019 with him. He used those words. He hasn\u2019t just asked me to open up our home a few times a year.\n\nEDIT part II: someone asked me to \u2018paint a better picture\u2019\n\n1.\t\u2060he speaks of her enthusiastically, which I\u2019m happy about. He becomes sullen and withdrawn when I don\u2019t join in the topic with equal enthusiasm.\n2.\the has started a college fund from our shared savings. We have a LOT in there, and I added to it thinking we could share an early retirement. That\u2019s gone out the window.\n3.\t\u2060he has taken over the second bedroom that used to be mine, and has decorated it so she has a space to stay. That\u2019s very well and good, except he has the basement which he recently spent 90k concerting into an at home gym. My second bedroom was my walk in closet/ shoe store, and now it\u2019s all packed away in suitcases while we figure out where it goes.\n4.\t\u2060he wants me to actively take an interest in her life, beginning with the visits and building up so that we function as a family. There\u2019s nothing wrong in that, except I never consented to being part of this type of family and he knew that.\n5.\t\u2060all of our vacation days have been wasted since he booked them more than a year ago and now he has used every single. one to visit her.\n\nWhen I ask him to let me go at my pace he is unable to see why it\u2019s important. He\u2019s making up for lost time, I am not.", "I know the title sounds awful but please read the full story. Every time I walk to my gym I see this cute little dog looking miserable. The dog (it\u2019s a she) is sometimes with her owner, a homeless guy in his 40s, but most of the time she gets tied to a pole and left there for hours. I wanted to report this to authorities but I was told that because most shelters in our area are kill shelters that could be even worse for the dog. Recently it\u2019s been showing a lot in my city and seeing the poor dog tied to the pole was just too much. A few nights ago my fianc\u00e9 and I were walking back from a restaurant in the area and saw the dog alone again, we decided to take her home. When I told my mother she was outraged, she says homeless people need their animals to keep them company and that I had no right to take her. I told her a dog isn\u2019t a toy and people shouldn\u2019t get one if they can\u2019t look after it. My mom says I\u2019m cruel and don\u2019t care about human beings. I disagree and maintain that you should not have an animal you can\u2019t take care of. We took the dog to the vet, he said she\u2019s a little over a year, malnourished but not critically. We scheduled her shots and made sure she was okay. The plan is either to keep her or let my aunt\u2019s family adopt her. We have two cats (they\u2019re used to dogs) and we\u2019re leaving our apartment to live in a house with a backyard in a few months. On the other and my 8 year old cousin fell in love with the dog from the moment she saw her. Regardless, we all live in the same city and will be there for the doggy to shower her with love. I just hope my mom gets over it.\n\n*For anyone wondering about the legality of what I did, my vet helped me out to make sure the dog was reported as abandoned and everything was legal. We\u2019ll be able to make the adoption official after a 30 day wait period.*\n\nUPDATE: as suggested by some of you in the comments, yesterday my fianc\u00e9 and my brother went to talk to the homeless guy to let him know where the dog is and how to claim ownership. However, authorities ruled this as animal abuse, so if the guy does claim ownership he can face charges (the guy knows this as well). Typically the waiting period for us to adopt the dog if the owner doesn't claim her would be 30 days, but because this is a case of abuse we might be able to finalize the adoption earlier. Seems like my aunt will adopt the dog since they're a family of 5 and someone's always home to take care of the dog. I understand the people telling me I should have talked to the guy earlier and I was a coward for not doing it. For people asking about temperatures, my city is in the mountains in northern Europe, snow and sub-freezing temperatures are a regular occurrence here. For people telling me to return the dog because the homeless guy is lonely, animals don't exist for our entertainment and loneliness isn't a valid excuse for animal abuse. Plenty of homeless people care for their animals and don't leave them alone in the cold.", "My mother passed away last month (my late father's already been gone for 2 years) and my siblings and after a pretty hectic month, we have finally sorted most things out and are getting back to our usual lives.\n\nThe situation is this: my mother's estate has about 300k worth of assets, which while she was living, we never discussed how it would be distributed. I didn't really care since I'm financially well off and make near 100k in the business field. My younger brother works in entertainment and earns about 45k while our youngest has autism spectrum disorder, lives independently but works a minimum wage job and relies on a lot of support to get by.\n\nMy mother's will stated her assets would be split up so that I get 20k, my brother gets 80k, and my ASD sister gets 200k (distributed over 10 years according to her will). We've met up to discuss this and my siblings have no issues with their share, but I have some resentment for how I'm receiving so much less because I stayed in school longer to get a career that makes more.\n\nHer will states it pretty clearly, and I kind of expected my mother to give more support to my siblings who need it more, but in my head I was thinking of a 20-30-50 split.  6.7% feels so unfair to me.", "My cousin is like a brother to me. He wanted to advance his education and career in the US so I offered to pay for his education and helped my cousin with his transition to his new life here by recommending him a job in the company I work in and let him stay in my property.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy cousin is the studious type, very academically inclined but socially awkward. Before coming to the US he never had a girlfriend before or many friends. He spends a lot of time on the computer and just studying preferring not to go out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen he met a girl. Fall in love and got married. He's in his late 20s and this was his first relationship\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe calls me one day. His wife wants to open up the relationship saying she is still young and wants to \u201cexplore her sexuality\u201d before \"truly\" settling down. He was CRUSHED. He calls me crying and it absolutely breaks my heart to hear him crying like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe talked bit more. This is a ongoing problem. Wife was insistent on her way and refused consulting or other professional help. In my opinion, when a woman wants to open up a relationship it means she is having an emotional affair wants her husband\u2019s permission to sleep with so that she is not a bad person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs his boss I can how this hurt him. He was unable to perform at work. I couldn\u2019t stand looking at him like that so I talk to him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Look, its clear that this is affecting you very badly. Have you consider taking up on her offer? Since she wants to open up?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe agrees to try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is he absolutely had no game at all. So I decided to help him out. Me and my wife spend a lot of time on his image. He's not poor as he is making 250k (I know as his boss). He just doesn\u2019t know how to present himself. We set up his social media accounts to make him more appealing. We went to meet girls together and we acted as his \u201cwing-buddies\u201d. I let him drive my car, (he was driving a Camry so he needs a much better ride) and one of my properties which is for investment purposes so he doesn\u2019t have to go back to his home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd guess what. It worked. He started getting laid. A LOT. We made sure to add all his hook ups in his social media so that his wife can see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis wife was not happy at all! She thought he would not be that \u201cwild\u201d and wanted their open relationship close. Once she knew it was me and my wife who helped him she called and scolded me. She was screaming and i couldn't be bothered hearing her screeching harpy voice so i just off the phone on her. This happened yesterday. Today I have been getting calls from her friends scolding me for being an asshole ruining their relationship. I basically just retort \u201cShe ruined their relationship. I am just helping my cousin\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't get it.She wants to open up the relationship, He got more successful than her and now she wants to close it, and its my fault that I'm ruining their relationship? So reddit users let me have it. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust want to say I agree with that most people here that their relationship is doom and should just cut it off. But he is an idiot with a set idea of how a relationship should work out. He does not want to divorce unless necessary, his wife doesn't want to consider  counseling. Me, I just personally wants him to be happy so I don't want to force the idea of a divorce to him. But i am working hard to lead him into that mindset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo answer many of the pm i am getting English is indeed not my first language but honestly it has never affect my ability to do my job.  I also have 2 masters so my English can't be that bad.  But i do apologize if i cause some of you guys to get cancer from reading my post.  As for my job I am a director in one of the MNC (Engineering field).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy cousin is just a very hard-working,  simple ,  thrifty man with simple needs who just happens to get a good job that pays well.  He don't spend unnecessarily. He invest well,  spend wisely and overall have a good head on his shoulder.  This I think have to do with the fact that his family is not well off.  And for Asian one of the way to elevate your economic status is to study hard,  which he excels in, Then get a good job. This habit stays with him into adulthood.", "When my husband and I found out that I\u2019m infertile we decided that we would still have children somehow. Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\n**Edit:**\n\n*So I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting this post to get this much attention. I\u2019ve actually cried reading some of the comments. I wasn\u2019t expecting people to go out of their way to offer resources and support to a complete stranger, so that\u2019s really humbling. I\u2019m doing my best to read everything you all write.*\n\n*For those asking, my son is seeing a child cognitive behavior therapist on a weekly basis. We were advised by another doctor that the cognitive behavioral therapy would be a good long term option. We are re-evaluating that advice now for obvious reasons. The problem is that it\u2019s very difficult to find someone qualified to deal with intense behavioral disorders in a child my son\u2019s age and we were lucky to find the person we did. Relocation is an option (although we would lose most of the family support we have here, which has been one of the only things keeping us going).*\n\n*As far as meds go, he\u2019s no longer taking anything except for a mild sedative to make him sleep. That\u2019s a long story. In short, he was misdiagnosed with ADHD and early onset bipolar disorder and given meds he shouldn\u2019t have been given. So now it\u2019s just the sleep aid.*", "My wife and I have been married for 10 years. We met in college, and she has been my best friend for almost 14 years now. She is beautiful, supportive, kind, classy, and all around amazing as a wife. \n\nWe went through a really rough patch about a year ago, mostly due to issues on my end. However, she told me she was pregnant. I was overjoyed. She told me she would only keep it if I was 100% in on the baby and the marriage, I said I was fully committed, and we kept the baby.\n\nAs time went on, I became increasingly insecure about whether or not the baby was mine. I did the math and thought it was unlikely it was mine, on top of having a gut feeling. I was internally agonizing over this for months, and after the baby was born, I could barely even hold him because I was so convinced he wasn't mine.\n\nI told my wife I wanted a paternity test. She was upset but told me to get one if it would ease my mind. The test comes back two weeks later and it says I am not the father.\n\nI'm absolutely livid. I had an out of body experience. I stormed into our house and just let loose. I felt like I couldn't stop myself, I was completely broken in that moment. I cried and screamed and asked her what I did to deserve this. I absolutely never laid a hand on her.\n\nThe whole time, she's just sitting on the couch, trying to comfort the baby. This made me even angrier for some reason, so I kicked her out right then and there. Told her to pack her bags and just get out.\n\nShe calls me the next day and tells me that I deserve to know that the baby is mine, and asks me to get a paternity test from another company. I figure I have nothing to lose at this point, and another paternity test can only help me in a divorce, so we get one at the company she suggested, and I sent a third to another company, just to be sure.\n\nI get the results from one and they say I am the baby's father. I wait a few days and don't say anything, then get the second set of results, also confirming I'm the father. I feel like the weight of the world has just been lifted off my shoulders and I can finally be the dad I want to be.\n\nI call my wife to give her the good news and she tells me she's not moving back in. She says she's disgusted with how I acted by asking for a paternity test and my reaction to the false one. She tells me I can come see my son, but she will be filing for divorce.\n\nI don't think my reaction was over the top for a man who thought he was being lied to about one of the most important things. I never showed any sort of violence and I was so emotionally broken at that point. I know how it must have looked to her, knowing that I was the father, but I don't think she's seeing it from my perspective. I'm planning on discussing it with her later and trying to convince her to work on it with me when I go see my son. AITA for reacting in this way to what I thought was an enormous deception?", "I was dating this girl for almost two years, and everything is going fine. We didn't have any arguments or fights or other \"couple drama\" that you'd think of. Our sex life was... scarce to say the least? She never wanted to go \"all-the-way\" to say the least. However, she expects me to get her off by other means but never does anything towards me. It was a point that really irritated me, but as I'm really antisocial and hate conflicts, I leave it be because I genuinely loved her. \n\nCue four months ago when she decides to break up with me by inviting me over in the middle of the night, just for me to walk in on her getting it from another guy. I was pissed and just left and went NC on her. A month ago she tries to reach out to me to apologize and get me to forgive her, which I don't, and I tell her to leave me alone. Now all night she was blowing up my phone while I was at work, after I got off I answered and she was balling her eyes out telling me her dad just died and she needed someone, but I don't care so I told her to fuck off and find someone who gives a fuck about her. I feel bad because I still do have a lot of feelings for her, but I don't want anything to do with her.\n\ntl;dr Girl breaks up with me by having me walk in on her with another guy, blows up my phone bawling because her dad died, I tell her to fuck off.", "I'm 44 with an 18 year old daughter and a 16 year old son. I'm a single father since my wife passed three year ago. Not that it's relevant, but both she and our second daughter passed during childbirth.\n\nI've been dealing with thoughts of mortality and death recently and figured I should get a will drafted to ensure my children are secure. Even though they're still young, I think at this point how they act and behave resembles what they will as they're older. I think most people become themselves around these ages.\n\nI want to split it 90/10 favoring my daughter. She's about to graduate university after an accelerated highschool program and my son wants to drop out the moment he can (here it's at 17). Here's a few things my son has done or has been a part of that cements my idea:\n\n- got two girls pregnant, both were terminated\n- has been expelled from one highschool and had to be put in another in a further district\n- has already been involved with the police for driving without a license, driving inebriated, and felonious assault (knife)\n\nAs much as I love my son since a father's love is unconditional, I don't _like_ him if that makes sense. I believe he has no future and it's not a function of his upbringing, else my daughter wouldn't be at her point. He's just a bad seed, it can't be helped despite my attempts.\n\nMy estate isn't huge. I'd give him nothing but at least 10% of my estate ensures he can't contest it and it's enough to get him a couple years of rent. If he makes a complete 180, sure I can get it changed, but I'm confident I won't have to.\n\nAm I the asshole, though?", "I'm 48M, girlfriend is 44F, her daughter is 21F, my sons are 23M and 25M but they're mostly irrelevant to this post. I've been dating girlfriend for six years.\n\nYears ago I bought both of my sons homes. I told them both the same budget, go find a house you like and let me see it, and I'll buy it for you. It was college graduation gifts sort of. I promised the same to my stepdaughter: graduate college, get a home wherever you want with a $200,000 budget. I firmly believe you can't get far in life with the current apartment rental rates, so this takes a major load off of shoulders.\n\nWell, she graduated this past April and my girlfriend is bugging me to get the ball into motion on getting her a house. The thing is that when I made that promise years ago, I assumed we'd be married by now. I want to get married, but she doesn't want to. I told her I don't feel comfortable buying a house for someone \"not officially in the family\" if that makes sense.\n\nNow the promise is if we get married, she can have a house, but I did make a compromise I could buy her a house but it remains in my name. My fear is I buy a house for someone, my girlfriend and I don't work out and split, then I've basically bought a house for a stranger.\n\nAm I being an asshole here? If it makes a difference, my girlfriend is a SAHM, stepdaughter lives with us. Stepdaughter works in a hospital right now but it's relatively far (city over, 40\\~min drive). I'm retired but have large savings, so I'm the only one with the money to make it happen.", "When me and GF met being a book nerd was a big part of her identity. She read regularly and even volunteered at her local library. Books were kinda her life and she even had ambitions to work for the library. As an avid reader my self, it is one of the things that attracted me to her. Fast forward a year and a half or so later and I can't even remember the last time I saw her reading a book. \n\nA username of hers came up in conversation, and the username references her being a book nerd. I pointed out that she doesn't read anymore and therefore is not a book nerd, and shoud make a different username. She defended herself saying that she is still a book nerd because she regularly listens to audiobooks. I tried to explain to her that this is not the same, because listening to something doesn't take as much brain power as reading it does. Audiobooks are like the cheap easy version of a real book. I don't thinks someone who *listens* to bools can classify themselves as a *reader*. I even told her I felt she was some what dishonest when we first started dating since she made it seems like books were so important to her, but now she doesn't read at all. She got mad at me and said I'm pretentious and a \"paper snob\". ", "So last night I got back to my dorm after working out at our campus gym. I realized walking back that I smelled awful and decided to grab my shower stuff and shower on our floor's bath/shower room. It was empty when I walked in so I went into a stall, closed the curtain, and started showering. Maybe a minute after I turned the water on, I heard the janitor wheel their mop bucket in to clean the bathrooms, which they seem to do at different times every day. The janitor, (female), heard my shower running and yelled for me to get out because she needed to clean. We already didn't have the best relationship because she also told me to leave two nights prior for walking in the bathroom while she was cleaning. This time instead of apologizing I just kept showering and acted like I couldn't hear her.\n\nMaybe another minute later I almost slipped and fell from fear because she started knocking on the wall next to the curtain, telling me I needed to leave right now. This time I told her that I was, \"almost done.\", and that I would be out soon. She told me she didn't care and that my RAs would be hearing about this. I take pretty quick showers, somewhere under 4-5 minutes but she made me feel like I had been in there for a half hour. I dried off, put my change of clothes on and walked out. She started to scold me about not respecting her, but I wasn't having it so I just walked past her without making eye contact and went back to my room. AITA?", "Front page? Cool!\n\nMy ex-girlfriend was overweight and I was an average, but not fit, guy. On one date we both said that we should become healthier. So we set goals to exercise more and to improve our diets. We don\u2019t live nearby so we wouldn\u2019t go to the same gyms. \n\nI started going to the gym almost every day. I really wanted to become healthier, but also wanted to encourage her to lose weight. She told me her super athletic friend was training her and helping her diet. \n\nWithin 4 months I\u2019d improved physically a lot more than anyone had even expected. She\u2019d gained more weight. I didn\u2019t find her physically attractive anymore. \n\nI asked her friend what they did at the gym. Her friend told me that they didn\u2019t go to the gym together. She had apparently never trained my girlfriend. When we went on dates it would be our \u201ccheat days\u201d so we\u2019d be eating unhealthy foods. Apparently she was still eating badly almost every day. \n\nI met with my girlfriend, broke up with her for lying to me and getting unhealthier. \n\nA lot of people are telling me that I\u2019m an asshole for breaking up with her, because I should never have tried to make her lose weight. Plus, by lying to me I got healthier.\n\n**Adding info**\n\nI don\u2019t want this post to turn into a fat-hating thing. \n\nI am happy that I\u2019ve gotten healthier and I guess by thinking we were both doing it I did improve and I\u2019m continuing to go to the gym. \n\nThis was a relatively short term relationship. 10 months total. \n\nThe reason for this situation irritating me the most was that she lied and didn\u2019t put any effort into it, but told me she was. If she\u2019d told me from day 1: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this\u201d then it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. The fact that she was telling me she had her friend training her made me think she was dedicated to it. \n\nI am not a perfect \u201clooks-don\u2019t-matter\u201d guy. Losing physical attraction to her did matter. \n\nThere were other issues for breaking up, but I considered this to be a serious one. \n\nShe told me the reason for not being straight up was because she liked that I was getting healthier and more attractive to her.

I\u2019ve been trying to explain to her that I\u2019ve been feeling like there\u2019s no intimacy between us for a long time. This isn\u2019t something that just happened, we\u2019ve been in a downward spiral for the last six years. Up until last October we barely saw eachother. She would go on walks before leaving for work and I wouldn\u2019t see her until later that night when I climbed into bed next to her sound asleep. We\u2019ve been living like roommates and staying together for the sake of our kids, who are six and eleven. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s cheated on me, but I suspect so, and really I don\u2019t care, our relationship isn\u2019t about us anymore and it hasn\u2019t been for a long time.\n\nI say until last October because she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I\u2019ve been by her side giving her the emotional support she needs and taking care of her when she\u2019s helpless due to chemo. If she\u2019d gone to screenings like I\u2019ve suggested to her over the years they could have caught it early enough that treatment would\u2019ve been more effective. But at this time we\u2019re planning our last Christmas together. \n\nI know it was wrong of me to cheat, and that probably makes me an asshole. But she wants to tell our kids that mom and dad need space from eachother and that she wants to move in with her mom. I think it's better if we act like nothing happened for the sake of our kids so that they have the memory of a happy family for the last year with their mother.  And if we live separately the kids will eventual find out why we split and they might hate me for it, causing lasting damage to our relationships. Of course, if she somehow makes a recovery, I'm more than open to the idea of a divorce.\n\nAm I the ass-hole for wanting to stay together for the sake of our children?", "I was/am outraged at what I heard my husband say to our 15 year old son about a week ago. Our son has started dating and he\u2019s been coming to me for advice since his dad is on the road for work a lot.

Just pay attention to what they do. Your mother will tell you things because she thinks they\u2019ll work, but trust me, it\u2019s better to just watch how they behave and change your behavior based on that.\u201d\n\nThis struck me as being incredibly sexist and dismissive of not just what I said but if who I am as a woman.

Neither mine nor his family has enough free time to travel much so this was a good opportunity for us to catch up.\n\nI recently broke up with my boyfriend and am going through a rough patch. Nothing serious, just a lot of negative emotions. I was excited to spend some time with family and get my mind off things. We catch up, have a fantastic dinner, drinks are flowing and I got quite tipsy. Me and Tom were snap chatting each other and making fun of our drunk parents. Suddenly our convo got a bit more playful. I put down my phone and tried to pay more attention to the heated Brexit debate that was taking place. I couldn't be bothered to listen so picked my phone up again and started downright flirting with Tom. We keep chatting over Snapchat throughout the entire night. It got quite late and everybody went to bed, me and Tom kept texting each other. I tell him to come to my room so we can watch a film. He did and as you can imagine we never got around to seeing the film.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe morning after, Tom and his parents were leaving early so I got up to say my goodbyes.

She proceeded to hear us have sex. And God was she upset. I got called pretty much every name in the book.  She said that she will not get over it and even if she does she will not forget it. Both mum and dad are not currently speaking to me. I am not sure if they will tell my uncle or aunt and I really hope not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy argument is that he isn't related to me, and there were no strings attached.

We were abstinent throughout dating, and she admitted to me that she doesn\u2019t think sex or ANY sexual contact is on the table, nor will it be for a long time. She said she\u2019s tried therapy but it didn\u2019t seem to work, so she\u2019s just been living with this demon for all of this time.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing; I didn\u2019t sign up for this. I\u2019m a very sexual person (yes, despite waiting nearly 3 years to get any). The thought of sex being off the table indefinitely scares the hell out of me.  In addition, I just feel betrayed. She didn\u2019t tell me ANY of this throughout dating; not even a hint. I\u2019m just thinking; shouldn\u2019t this be a thing you tell your supposed love of your life **before** you\u2019re married? Especially if it\u2019s going to continue to cause issues in the future?\n\nI didn\u2019t bring up annulment to her, but I would be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t weighing on my mind. I feel like I don\u2019t even know her anymore. Who is the person I married? Does she have anything else she\u2019s hiding from me? How long will I have to wait until I can make love to my own wife; or will I just be in a dead bedroom situation for the rest of my life? I feel like if I wait and get a divorce instead, it will be MUCH more costly (she doesn\u2019t work at all, and I pay for everything).\n\nI\u2019m terrified of going to my close family and friends. She knows I\u2019ve been acting distant since she\u2019s told me, and I haven\u2019t found a way to bring it up. AITA? Am I right to feel betrayed?\n\n---\n\nEDIT: The reason she told me during the day of the actual wedding, because sex was obviously on the table because we were now married, and she felt like she couldn't do it. Before then, she never really had a need to justify why she didn't want to have sex\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE**: So I decided I needed it to talk to her. I broached the subject gently. I told her I understood that it was a deeply personal, painful thing that's happened to her, but I would be lying if I said I didn't feel betrayed that she didn't tell me until after the marriage. She started crying again and said she's sorry, she didn't me to think she's broken and that she didn't mean to betray me. That she knew sex was important and she felt like after the trust and commitment that goes into a marriage, she convinced herself she would be okay after the marriage before realizing she's not. She already booked multiple different therapists appointment since our talked and she **begged** me not to leave.\n\nI told her that I didn't want to leave her, but I was considering getting an annulment. I by no means want to break up, but I think it would be best to work on this issue before we're married. She broke down some more and started bawling. She begged me to not give up on her and that she loved me. I tried to tell her I wasn't giving up on her; I love her, but she needs to realize what she did was a serious betrayal. She just couldn't stop crying and told me that she knows and that she didn't mean to hurt me and that she's sorry and to please don't leave her. She said she's ready now and that we can have sex and it's not that big a deal. She even started coming on to me and touching me and insisted that it was okay. I told her I couldn't and that I was going to take a walk and she started crying some more. \n\nI'm walking now. Obviously she's not really ready and she's only saying it to save the marriage and at this point I just don't know what to do...\n\n---\n\n**LAST UPDATE. PLEASE READ**\n\nSorry for the late update. So after the last one, she texted me. She told me she didn't realize sex was so important to me, and that she's willing to give it a shot. She's learned this \"disassociation\" trick when her abuse was at an all time high, where she's able to completely disassociate from the situation. She says that if she wants her to be an active participant, it will take some time, but she would rather just disassociate in the meantime than risk annulling the wedding.\n\nWell I know Reddit's filled with the overly hivemind-y \"she's trying to trap you\" BS, but that pretty much solidified that it's complete crap. *She would rather endure a painful and traumatic experience over and over again than risk losing me*. I decided to say to hell what the annulment. I love this person, and I'm going to try to make it work. \n\nShe already has her therapy appointment scheduled, and in the meantime, we're going to try to work through this issue together. She's a lot more comfortable now that the whole secret's out and she doesn't feel like she has to hide anything. We slept naked together (no sex) for the first time ever, just a quick nap, and are going to progress from there at her pace. Thanks for all of your comments!\n\n**And because I apparently didn't make it clear enough, I'm NOT going to have sex with her as she disassociates.** She just offered it. I did not accept.", "Throwaway~A bit long winded, but, here we go. \n\nI recently got engaged to the man of my dreams in April 2019. Set to be married in September of 2020. Even before we got engaged, my fiancee and I agreed that we were going to keep it on the smaller side and only invite our close friends/family. Now, I have four other siblings that I'm not close to. I only \"talk\" to one and that's putting it lightly. I've chosen not to invite the remaining three and only invite the one that I speak to. My mother wasn't particularly pleased, but, she understood at the time. \n\nWe already went through bullshit with his side of the family due to the fact that I didn't want to invite everyone from his side of the family, which would be an additional 60+ people to our list. My fiancee and I had already had a list of everyone he wanted to invite on his side of the family and mine. It was a huge thing where we eventually compromised on inviting a large portion, but, not all. They essentially threatened to not help pay for the wedding, so, I felt a bit bullied into giving in. \n\nFlash forward to the past few weeks. My mother has had a falling out with the one sibling I speak to and now wants me to invite one of the one's who I have literally no relationship with. I've told her no many times and to please be civil and respect my wishes. Today, she threw the fact that we are inviting my fiancee's family to the wedding (though it was a different scenario in my opinion) and said she isn't coming to the wedding unless I invite him. \n\nAt this point, I'm over all of it. I haven't been able to enjoy being engaged because it's been family drama and I'm not even looking forward to planning the wedding. We have planned a large portion and most of everything has been paid for out of our pocket. I suggested we just cancel the damn thing and elope to my fiancee and he agreed. \n\nWIBTA to cancel it and just elope?\n\nEdit: Spelling\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for the resounding support during this difficult time, we both greatly appreciate it. I've read through every comment and most have been so kind, even the not so kind ones have helped shed light in a different perspective. I will keep you all updated in the next few days/weeks with a decision. Thanks again!", "To preface, I had meningitis as a kid and now have neither of my arms. My right arm was amputated at the shoulder and my left amputated just above my elbow. Therefore, I have absolutely no use of my arms. I do everything with my feet or someone else does it for me. I have an all day caregiver that I pay to help me with most things. \n\nI live with my fianc\u00e9e and the above mentioned caregiver. My fianc\u00e9e and caregiver used to do all of the cooking because I never dared to try cooking with my feet. That was until recently. I saw a video on Facebook a few months ago of a young woman cooking a meal successfully with her feet. This inspired me and I\u2019ve gotten quite good at it. This is all 100% sanitary as I wash my feet thoroughly before and throughout the process. \n\nI invited a couple of friends over for dinner, both of them having had meals with us before. Previously, my caregiver had cooked for us (she\u2019s an awesome cook and loves to cook) when my friends were over. This time, we served dinner and all was well. It was delicious and everyone seemed to enjoy it. My friends turned to my caregiver and said \u201cwow, that was delicious thanks *caregiver*\u201d and my caregiver replied that this meal was all my doing. The look on my friends faces was absolutely horrified as they realized the implications of what that meant. Both of my friends gave me a funny look and left in a hurry. I was shocked and upset by their reaction. \n\nThis morning I woke up to a text telling me how uncool that was and that I shouldn\u2019t have cooked with my feet because that\u2019s dirty and gross. They say that they\u2019re afraid of getting sick and feel violated. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:  Thank you all! This comment thread has given me some much needed clarity surrounding this situation. I appreciate everyone\u2019s comments. Side note: I almost want to say to them if they ever cook dinner for me \u201cyou cooked this with your *HANDS* how could you? You wipe your ass with those hands, you know?\u201d\n\nEdit 2: Since this apparently wasn\u2019t already obvious, there is NO direct feet to food contact. I use my feet to pick up utensils that in turn touch the food. I\u2019m not sitting there kneading bread between my toes or mixing together a meatloaf. If anything ever called for something that needs direct contact, someone else would do that part or would just make the recipe all together. \n\nAlso, PLEASE stop asking how I typed the post acting like it\u2019s impossible for this to be real because I can\u2019t type. That\u2019s an incredibly ignorant and rude comment to make. It\u2019s hard to believe people don\u2019t understand talk to text exists, especially when it is used by many able bodied people too.\n\nEdit 3: wow, I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up the way it has. Thank y\u2019all for your comments and thank you strangers for the awards!", "Husband and I are having a moral dilemma concerning our kids. \n\nWe have two kids (14F/16M). When they were 10 and 12 my husband and I both became vegetarians. Then last year we became vegan. We never forced our diet on them but we do talk to them about our beliefs concerning animal cruelty and animal products. They know that we\u2019re serious about our new lifestyle and it\u2019s not temporary.\n\nNow our kids still eat meat when they\u2019re at school and we\u2019re fine with that. They know we only cook vegan dishes at home. But recently they\u2019ve been lashing out at rules we\u2019ve established concerning meat in the house. We don\u2019t permit any meats or animal based foods in our house or fridge (they can eat whatever they want outside the house) but our kids think we\u2019re being unfair to them. \n\nLast week my daughter had friends over and they ordered a pepperoni pizza when my husband and I were out of the house. When we got back and saw the boxes we told her she disrespected us and our rules and grounded her for 2 weeks. But now her and our son are both lashing out, calling us terrible parents and threatening to move out and live with their uncle. We don\u2019t think we did anything wrong but I\u2019m not sure what we could\u2019ve done better.\n\nAWTA?", "A friend of mine's wife had gotten pregnant, and on a night out he took me away from everyone to tell me the awesome news, but asked me to promise not to tell anyone. My wife's friends are also in the same group, so he asked if I could please not tell her (especially as his wife was only eight weeks pregnant) until they had attended their 12-week scan to confirm everything was ok.\n\nI agreed, and kept it to myself. Week 12 comes along and the pregnancy is announced - I told my wife how happy I was to be able to talk about it with her having known for a little while, which is when the argument started. She feels that as her wife there should be absolutely no secrets, regardless of if anyone wants me to keep it from her.\n\nAm I the asshole for not telling her after making a promise that I wouldn't?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses everyone. To clarify a few things:\n\n- The scan (and the subsequent scan) went well, they have a healthy baby on the way!\n- I don't think my friend was the asshole, he was excited and probably quite nervous pending the scan. I have children so the conversation was able to lead into questions/concerns shared. He's going to be a great Father.\n- My wife can tend to tell her Mother and sisters secrets that they shouldn't/don't need to know. I don't think she would have let on about this, but my friend was probably worried she might.\n- We have spoken about not keeping secrets before, and I do keep to that. We do however also agree that promises must be kept, I feel this was an acceptable secret to keep given the circumstances. The promise was made after being told, and asked to not tell.", "My friendship with Dave- he\u2019s been my mate for 15 years, we\u2019ve been through some shit together, and he\u2019s always been my most solid friend. He\u2019s always been prone to get jealous around me with girls and whichever women are in our lives, either separately or together, he will get very weirdly competitive. However, for various reasons both of us have been single pringles for longer than we\u2019ve been in relationships, but he\u2019s honestly like a brother to me. He\u2019s been a shoulder to cry on when my mum passed away, I helped him buy a house, he bought me my first dog, etc. \n\nMy girlfriend Safia- I\u2019ve known her since last November. My gym buddy had been pushing me to meet her and despite me not really wanting a gf, it happened one day and we hit it off big time. I\u2019ve known her 6 months and I can tell you right now she\u2019s the fucking one for me.\n\nShe is never in a million years the type of girl I\u2019d go for. She is completely out of my league. Lip fillers, makeup obsessed, runs around making friends with cats on the street, loves pink anything, calm as anything, has a degree in biomedical science, works for an organisation that *advises the bloody NHS* and is sharply intelligent. When I introduced Dave and Saf to each other I was sure they\u2019d love each other. But nope. Despite me thinking Safia is the most interesting fucking person to walk this earth, Dave has been nothing but hostile to her and is openly rude. She first took it well and privately I apologised profusely to her. Asked Dave wtf his issue was and he called her a bimbo, vapid, etc. \n\nSince then it\u2019s progressed into him openly calling her blondie (she has dark hair), him telling me she\u2019s after my money, him telling me that I need to break up with her because she\u2019s only using me and someone like her would never want to be with someone like me. Safia has said literally nothing about him, and I know she has an insecure streak where she feels like people don\u2019t like her as it is, so naturally I\u2019ve stopped seeing Dave as much. \n\nHe\u2019s called me drunk last night and told me how I\u2019ve let a \u2018loose pussy get in between him and I\u2019 ... I\u2019m honestly done with his guy. Am I doing the right thing by severing this relationship? In the last 6 months my life has been getting better and better- and coincidentally I\u2019ve been seeing him less and less. Him disrespecting my girlfriend is the nail in the coffin as far as I\u2019m concerned, but my other friends think this is a classic case of me being caught up in a shiny new relationship and not seeing the bigger picture.", " \n\nThrowaway\n\nOkay, I have a two-month-old and am currently on paternity leave. I\u2019m fortunate to work at a place that\u2019s family-oriented and where I\u2019m a senior employee. I\u2019m able to get a longer than typical paternity leave by working remotely from home. However, I had to go into the office to get documents that could only be accessed on my work computer. I thought I would give my wife a break and let her sleep in. So I grabbed my kid and headed to the office.\n\nOnly my boss knew I was coming in, so the office was surprised. And as people do, they gravitated towards the baby. Lots of cooing, holding, passing around, etc. This was all taking place inside my office. Then my baby started crying. I told my assistant that she can rock baby or walk around the office and they\u2019ll go back to sleep. My assistant took her outside my office by her desk and I worked on gathering what I needed from my computer.\n\nI stop hearing crying and look up to see my assistant on her phone, no baby in her arms. I rush out and ask where my kid is. She said asked one of the interns, let\u2019s call her Mary, to take her because she got a call from a client.\n\nLike most places, my office has summer interns who are college students. I\u2019ve only met them once during the interviews months ago but I went on paternity leave before they started and haven\u2019t worked with them like the rest of the office has. I know nothing about them personally since I\u2019ve been out of the office.\n\nI went over to where the intern desks are and ask where Mary was and they said she went to the bathroom. I asked if she had my baby they said she thinks so and I asked one of the female employees if she could go to the bathroom to get her. A minute later, they both come back, baby with Mary and diaper bag on her arm.\n\nI took my kid from her arms and told her I didn\u2019t appreciate her walking off with my kid. Mary said my assistant asked her to hold the baby and when she did, it seemed like baby needed a diaper change so she went and did that. I told her I appreciate the sentiment but didn\u2019t like the idea of a stranger walking off with my baby.\n\nIn private, I told my boss that how I felt and that I would feel uncomfortable extending her a job offer at the end of her internship but the status of her employment now was up to my boss to decide.\n\nWhen I told my wife, she said I went too far. The girl was doing a simple task and that she probably was given an \u201cintern task\u201d. I reiterated that the girl was a stranger and we wouldn\u2019t let a stranger change our kid\u2019s diaper anywhere else why work? Work doesn\u2019t stop people from being psychos. Wife said she understood that but that I didn\u2019t need to jeopardize the intern\u2019s future employment and that I was throwing my weight around since I\u2019m high in command.\n\nAITA?", "Her daughter is 16, we\u2019re both in our 40s. Her daughter Ashley is from a previous relationship; my wife and I have been married 7 years and together for 10.\n\nTo put it bluntly, Ashley\u2019s a huge brat. She always has this horrible attitude, never does the minimal chores we assign her (make sure her room/bathroom is cleaned and wash the dishes; that\u2019s it), she\u2019s always partying coming home drunk at 4 in the morning, and always bringing home different dudes to spend the night.\n\nI don\u2019t really have any parental authority over Ashley at the request of my wife because her father\u2019s still in the picture, but I\u2019m just sick of the way she treats and raises her child. She just brushes off her delinquency with \u201cshe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d I\u2019m not against kids having fun, but come on; why is there a stranger at MY house at 2 in the morning?\n\nShe thinks because she\u2019s \u201calmost an adult\u201d, that gives her a free ride to do whatever she wants, never mind the fact that she\u2019s just finished her sophomore year in high school. Her mother thinks as long as she\u2019s safe and responsible, we should just let her \u201cfind herself\u201d, while I think she\u2019s needs to step up and be a PARENT; enforce rules, give punishments, and actually RAISE her child besides letting her act like a fucking delinquent. We\u2019ve had multiple talks about it, and it always ends with \u201cyou don\u2019t get to tell me how to raise my child.\u201d And while that\u2019s true, I want kids and we (were) actively trying for a baby. But my thought process is: if this is the way you\u2019re going to raise *your* child, what\u2019s stopping you to raise our future children like this?\n\nI decided I didn\u2019t want this for myself and I didn\u2019t have the right to parent her child, but I didn\u2019t want my child to be raised like this. So I talked to a divorce attorney and am probably going to proceed in a divorce. \n\nThe reason why I feel like I might be TA she has no house and will probably have to move back with her parents (across the country). I got a prenup because there\u2019s quite an income disparity between us (she works part-time at minimum wage while I work at a fortune 500). Her kid would have to uproot her life and everything she\u2019s known. And I don\u2019t hate the kid; I just think her parent is failing her right now.\n\nThis is our only issue, but one that\u2019s been coming up frequently for the last year and a half. I feel like at this point, it\u2019s just a fundamental incompatibility. AITA?", "Moving this further up because people seem to disregard the edits: her English skills are adequate, she knows enough to get by but struggles from time to time. \n\nSo I (19F) just got into an argument with my mum (47), and long story short it all started from when I made a comment about how her and my father can barely speak English, despite having lived here for 20 years. \n\nWhat started off as something I said in passing blew up into something which led to an explosive argument and lead to me storming off to my room. You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\nEdit: Just for clarification, she doesn\u2019t have much family here, most of them scattered to different parts of the world after the war. She\u2019s been through hell and back and most of her direct family were slaughtered by a terrorist group in front of her, she fled to Italy and later moved to England after she met my dad and had me. That\u2019s just a bit of background info if it helps with anything. \n\nEdit #2: She knows enough to get by, she just struggles a bit. Tried to enrol to college, stayed there for a year, had another child and she works full time whilst supporting 5 kids. Father doesn\u2019t really help out, the way I may have said it makes it sound likes she knows jack shit, but that\u2019s not the case. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is she\u2019s lost hope and instead she tries her best to pay for our tuition and books and stuff, for us to have a better future than her. But it still annoys me because I want her to live a good life too. \n\nEdit #3: wow it actually kind of hurts to see my mum being spoken about such a way in the comments. I feel the need to defend her.\n\nShe speaks English to an acceptable degree, can read and write but if you were to use complex words or phrases she would need a translator.\n\nE.g. when speaking to people from the city council, she would be need some assistance bc of the terminology they would use. She\u2019s not hopeless but considering how long she has been here, I just think she could have done more. \n\nP.s. she\u2019s fluent in Italian tho lol", "Today I was doing some minor maintenance on my car. It leaks oil really badly so I was under the hood checking the fluids and all of that. I had my ear buds listening to Spotify when I look up and am VERY startled to see two teenage girls not only in my yard, but very uncomfortably close to me. I have an exaggerated startle response due to trauma and being caught off guard like that immediately caused me distress, but I tried very hard to remain calm. \n\nI removed my ear buds and asked them what I could do for them. They were kind of chattering amongst themselves and ignoring me. Basically, they wanted a ride and were rudely debating if my car could even run all right there in front of me. It was really annoying. You ever have someone blatantly talking shit about you like you literally aren't standing right there hearing every word and then have the absolute audacity to ask for your help? Yeah. So anyway I told them to kick rocks. I didn't even know who these two were and this is not the kind of neighborhood to just wantonly wander onto someone else's property without invitation.\n\nWell, they weren't trying to hear all of that and started talking even more shit. Insulting my car, which fine whatever it IS a piece of shit, but they crossed the line by making some insinuations about me as a person, basically implying that I was a lesbian for working on my own car and I needed a man to do that. Basically, they were really trying me but I didn't want to get into it with two literal children. As an adult, that's a seriously bad look so I just kept telling them to get to stepping but they would not. \n\nIt really seemed to me that they were trying to intimidate me by acting hard and bowing up at me. It was really embarrassing so finally I just had enough and hosed them down. This is Florida so it was like 75 out. Anyway, that did the trick and they left immediately.\n\nAm I?", "Sorry for any grammatical errors or formatting problems I\u2019m typing on mobile. \n\nSo my birthday is tomorrow and I\u2019m inviting some friends tomorrow to play smash ultimate. I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up like this . \nAnyway here\u2019s some answers to some questions.\n\nI\u2019m 14 turning 15 \n\nMy mom says I\u2019ve seen this kid before, but I feel like it\u2019s in the sense of that Aunty that changed your diaper when you were 1 year old that you don\u2019t remember.\n\nI asked my mom if we\u2019re cousins that I maybe didn\u2019t know about . She said no.\n\nApparently my mom gives my old clothes to him . \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stand up to my parents. Maybe if I were older and had something to fall back on.\n\nMy dad said the kid is staying because his mom wants to go to church and they live really far so it\u2019s just easier to stay the night.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time they pulled something and didn\u2019t tell me. Around Christmas time my mom signed me up for volunteering at a Christmas play and she didn\u2019t mention it until we got in the car.  We were there for 5 minutes and they didn\u2019t mention we were doing this as a family. The Christmas play was late night and really long so it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do on my Saturday night. I guess they realized they were in the wrong and didn\u2019t make me go.\n\n\n\nEdit 2:  Hey guys I\u2019m back . I\u2019m gonna tell you about my birthday party. So of the 5 people I invited only 1 came and the 10 year old. We had a good time laughing and stuff and I\u2019m pretty friendly with the 10 year old now. The friend left around 15 minutes and we\u2019re just here watching  American idol. I guess I became friends with him.", "I was booking a train for a trip and the App told me during the booking process that the train will be full and that I should consider reserving a seat. I went for it since its only 4.50 Euro and I really needed to get some work done during the trip. \n\nThe train was absolutely packed, but I quickly found my seat and saw that a pregnant woman sat in it. I showed her my reservation and politely asked her to leave, already earning some judging looks from the other passengers. She refused and went on a pretty long tirade, calling me disrespectful and a disgrace for men.\n\nI didnt want to make a huge scene and felt really awkward so I offered her to buy the seat from me for 4.50 Euro. She refused again and called me a greedy son of a bitch. \n\nAt that point I got really pissed, waited for the conductor and informed him about the situation. He asked the lady to leave and I was able to sit. However, everybody was staring me into the ground.\n\nI really dont know how to feel about this. I think I was in the right but obviously the other passengers didnt feel the same way. I havent talked about it with family or friends, afraid of their reaction.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here?", "My family and I grew up very poor. From when I was old enough to legally work, I (19F) have had to take on multiple jobs while balancing school to help with my family and my younger sister. Growing up, I never had a lot and whatever money I earned I would spend on my sister (16F) and family. When I was 18 and had just been accepted into college, my dad's business that he'd worked on for the past couple of years finally took off. This also meant that my sister could now have a normal high school experience without worrying about money.\n\nWhile I was in college, I wasn't in contact with my sister that much since I was so busy with schoolwork. However, from our calls and her social media, I could tell she had changed completely and was involved with some bad people. She would post videos on her snapchat of her getting drunk, smoking weed, juuling, driving while most likely drunk/high, etc. I tried reaching out to her, but she would mostly deny the claims and told me to mind my own business. At some point, she justified her actions using the argument, \"This is what the cool kids do now, not everyone was a nerd like you in high school.\" One of my high school friends who also has a brother in the same grade reach out to me and said that she heard that my sister was seeing a sketchy guy from another school. Apparently he sells drugs and was expelled from my sister's high school. I asked my sister about this and she denied it.\u00a0\n\nLast week I got a phone call from my mom who was sobbing. She tells me that my sister is pregnant. I was so shocked that I could not speak. Then I was angry. When I was her age and even younger, I gave her everything and so did my parents so she could have all the opportunities her peers had. Since my dad's business became lucrative, they've given her every opportunity to succeed (any extracurricular/sport she wants, academic tutoring, school activities, etc.). I never got any of those things. It angered me so much that she took all of this for granted and fucked up her life. The father? Her delinquent \"boyfriend\" who got expelled and sells drugs.\u00a0\n\nShe blows up my phone but I don't respond. She then sends me a series of long text messages asking if she can crash at my place. She also asked me if I could make her an appointment to see a doctor. Lastly, she asked if it would be okay if her boyfriend comes and stays over sometimes. I shut her down. I told her that you dug this hole for yourself. If you allowed yourself to become pregnant, then you should be able to deal with the consequences. Also, I\u2019m currently sharing a small apartment with two roommates! She begged some more and I denied her. In the past few days, she's still be texting me and calling me non-stop saying that she has nowhere to go and has been living in her boyfriend's car. I haven't responded to a single message of hers, but I feel my resolve wavering a bit. I fully don't support her, but maybe I'm being an asshole?\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I would still NEVER house her in my apartment. That would be extremely disrespectful towards my roommates and would get me kicked out due to the lease agreement. I meant I was considering giving in and sending her some money.\n\nEDIT 2: My parents have DISOWNED her, not kicked her out. They are refusing to acknowledge that she is their daughter, but she is still welcome to live in their house. She chose not to since my parents are absolutely fuming and probably will yell at her and criticize her, which she honestly needs.", "Normally my MIL visits us every spring. She works at a school so she spends spring break with us. She is a kind and sweet woman, but she lets her daughter push her around and is not very bright. I have to keep a close eye on her to make sure she\u2019s not creating dangerous situations for my small children. I like her, but it\u2019s difficult to have her here. \n\nLast summer she planned to come out in July (without asking us first) instead of March with my SIL and her husband as well . Turns out this was all the sisters idea. My SIL has never visited us, never met either of my children. Overall is just a terrible person. I can\u2019t stand her because of the way she treats my husband. \n\nSo basically it went like this: \nSIL: We\u2019re coming out for this week in July. \n\nMe: That\u2019s not a good time for us, Husband can\u2019t take time off work that week. I have plans. Let\u2019s look at a different week. \n\nSIL: No that\u2019s all we can do. So we will be there. End of discussion. \n\nSo I changed all my plans. We set up the beds. Had everything ready for a visit that we didn\u2019t want to host. Then they don\u2019t show up and check in on fb getting on a cruise ship. I have to say I was pretty relieved that I didn\u2019t have to spend a week with my SIL and try to hide the fact that I\u2019d like to kill her. My husband on the other hand was devastated. No one called him or let him know. We had to tell the kids memaw wasn\u2019t coming to visit after all. It was a disaster. \n\nSo now, my MIL wants to just pretend nothing ever happened and come visit us in March this year. I told my husband no. I said I don\u2019t want her here until she acknowledges how badly she and her daughter hurt his feelings and the feelings of my kids. They were completely out of line and I will not ignore that! \n\nAITA for not allowing this to be swept under the rug? \n", "So my room mate, let's call her S, is a good friend of mine and we've been living together just under a year. However since she broke up with her boyfriend she's been bringing a lot of guys over. No problem, you do you.\n\nHowever I get up for work early on the weekends (which obviously she's well aware of) and recently she's been bringing guys over and making a lot of noise watching TV in the living room which is close to my bedroom.\n\nNow, the TV is mine, I pay for the internet and the PS4 she's using to run Netflix is mine (yep my account). After a couple of weeks of letting it slide and talking to her during the week nothing changed. So on saturday night after asking her to keep the noise down her latest date was laughing and turned up the volume. So I unplugged the TV, took the PS4 and moved it all into my room, locked my door and changed the wifi password. Now she's calling me a dick and saying she doesn't feel like she can bring guys over if I'm going to 'make a big deal about it'.\n\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I'm a dude. And the reason I pay for the broadband/netflix and let S use my stuff is cos I make quite a bit more than her so I don't chase what would be roughly 20 quid a month for splitting those services. And my TV is a lot bigger than hers which she keeps in her room.", "This happened ages ago and has been an ongoing joke in my family for years, they think I'm definitely TA but I disagree.\n\nI have always been a picky eater and still am, I'm sure I'm not alone but I have always had people comment on the way I eat, how little I eat and I can't stand being critiqued on my eating habits. \n\nThis story takes place when I was about 9 years old. I was having dinner with my family. I had some potato waffles and baked beans (among other things) on my plate. The sauce from the baked beans had spread over and was soaking the edges of my waffles. I don't like the way it makes my crispy waffles soggy so decided to trim the edges of my waffles with my knife and fork. My Dad saw me doing this and said very condescendingly \"pfft what are you doing?! It all gets mixed up in your tummy anyway\" and laughed to himself.\n\nI know it gets all mixed in my tummy anyway. But before that it has to go in my mouth and I don't want cold, soggy, slightly tomatoey potato on my tongue because it's gross. I'm also annoyed that he called belittled my eating habits in front of the whole family and made fun of me for something that has absolutely no effect on him whatsoever.\n\nSo I got up, walked round to where my Dad was sitting, picked up his glass of beer and poured it over his dinner. He tried to grab my hand and stop me, but it was already too late. He shouts \"What are you doing!?\" and I said \"what's wrong, it all gets mixed up in your tummy anyway\"\n\nI remember my older brother and sister thought this was hilarious, my Mum was annoyed that I ruined the dinner she'd made for my Dad (fair enough, sorry Mum) and my Dad was furious. I said he shouldn't have made fun of me for something that didn't matter to him. I was grounded for a week afterwards but my Dad has never made fun at me eating since.\n\nAnyway, AITA? I'm sure some fellow picky eaters will back me up.", "So my friend I have known since kindergarten ( I\u2019m almost 40) married my wife\u2019s sister. Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\nEdit: I really don\u2019t feel like the Asshole. I just wanted to bounce this off a bunch of people to see if the creepy feels are justified.  \n\nEdit2: Clarifications and additional detail.  My wife is fully on board with him not seeing our daughter she just hates losing her sister. \n\nBIL and SIS in law  will have their first child in A few months. \n\nYes I think there are developing mental issues with BIL. Depression seems most likely but it\u2019s no excuse for the strange behavior. \n\nHe also has been very standoffish to me and my wife lately. \n\nBIL also didn\u2019t want to have a girl because he didn\u2019t want it to take away from his love for my daughter. SIL actually told me this like it was so sweet and endearing. I feel sick writing this. \n\nOh ya. I was tactful and calm when talking to him.  I might have been pushy at first but it\u2019s Hugh tension convo. I repeatedly ask why he did not see that it was wrong. He did not see anything wrong with his behavior. Annnnnnnd I recorded the conversation since it was such a serious discussion. No I will not share it for obvious reasons. \n\nEdit: thank you for the feedback. As a small\nMajority have pointed out it might be harmless (albeit still creepy) and I have thought about that.  It sure does suck for everyone involved if that\u2019s the case. The consequences of not addressing this and something actually bad happening , I could never forgive myself. \n\nFinal edit: Thank you again for the advice everyone. A lot of you shared your personal experiences with abuse to assure me I did the right thing and that in itself is not an easy thing to extend to a stranger. He\u2019s a creep any way you look at it. There have been a lot of questions asking for more details and I don\u2019t really want to write out more because this situation sucks. There is even more disturbing instances me and my wife drug back up today and look at them\nWith new clarity after reading your comments  ( I took off work today because I have been a basket case since speaking with him yesterday) from this year that are even worse. We are very confident this had not escalated to a physical stage yet. I wrote this around 4:00 in the morning laying awake(I apologize for the bad phrasing).  \n\nTo be clear, he will never be around my daughter again. \n\nThat\u2019s all I feel like sharing on this topic. ", "Hey gang, \n\n\nAs a long time lurker I now am stepping into the spotlight. I\u2019m 28 and my fianc\u00e9 is 30.  We both 120k/year. We\u2019re getting married in two months. For years, we\u2019ve talked about taking an extended honeymoon of 4 months to travel since we\u2019re both in competitive jobs and taking time off regularly just isn\u2019t possible. \n\n\nTo make this dream a reality, a year and a half ago we agreed to start saving aggressively, pay debts, have a no-frills wedding, etc. My job only allowed me to take 2 weeks off (1 unpaid) for a honeymoon so I said okay but will be quitting instead. Travel for an extended time is a dream of mine and we\u2019ve been setting ourselves up financially where we can afford for one (or both) of us to not have immediate work upon return. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s job told him he can take the (unpaid) sabbatical and can return afterwards. So great, everything is in motion. \n\n\nTwo weeks ago, I suggested we start booking the first leg of our trip. He told me he was having cold feet about me not having a job after return home. We keep our finances separate so I showed him how it\u2019s financially feasible for me to not work up to 4 months, NOT dip into \u201cemergency funds\u201d and if needed, I have emergency funds for an additional 5 months AFTER trip expenses. After all, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve aggressively set ourselves up to do. Plus, I\u2019ve been looking for a reason to leave my job and this is the perfect opportunity to have an amazing adventure and come back with a fresh start away from a toxic workplace. I ask him how he\u2019s doing financially and how he\u2019s tracking against our financial goals. Turns out he\u2019s not. At all. He hasn\u2019t been saving at any rate, let alone an accelerated one and he hasn\u2019t been paying down debt. He\u2019s been spending a lot of money on drinks, toys, and general convenience premiums (Postmates, Uber Eats). Because of his general overspending, he can\u2019t afford to take a destination honeymoon, let alone take 4 months off work for no pay. \n\n\nAll this is fine. We keep our finances separate. This doesn\u2019t really impact me. I was bummed we couldn\u2019t have the honeymoon we talked about and angry he lied but money management has never been his priority.\n\n\nI told him we can take a honeymoon 4 day trip to Puerto Rico (he said that\u2019s all he could afford) and then I would go on my long travel plans with my best friend who has been planning a trip of her own. He got very upset, telling me I should wait to take our designated honeymoon trip together and that I shouldn\u2019t \u201creplace\u201d him. \n\n\nAs of now, I\u2019m still going. He\u2019s unhappy and says it\u2019s embarrassing to him for his new wife to go travel without him, which I understand but also don\u2019t really think his ego takes precedence over my dream to travel (which he fueled for the last year and a half). So, AITA?\n\n**Edit: the entire time he was telling me we were \u201con track\u201d for this sabbatical and shared excitement, had destination bucket lists, etc. I didn\u2019t force him and if he would have told me he didn\u2019t want to go we would\u2019ve planned a normal honeymoon and I would have traveled at a later date (not immediately after marriage) or even before marriage (we have talked about doing something like this before engagement even)**", "So I (21F) and a few of my friends all in their twenties were out a coffee shop one day. Im much closer to one then the other. I went up to order and there was a guy about our age behind the counter. Two of my friends were behind me in line. I asked for a coffee. As I was swiping my card and waiting for it to authorize I looked at those huge cookies they had behind the glass and commented to my friends behind me that they looked really good. One of my friends said they did and she would get one since I already paid. \n\nAs the guy was getting my receipt he told me to wait and went and got one of the cookies out of the thing and said it was on him. I thought that was very nice, thanked him and went to wait for my coffee. The other girl with my friend said she wanted a cookie and got one after me. When she had to pay for it she said to the guy \u201coh so they\u2019re not free\u201d it was awkward but brushed off by everyone. \n\nWhen all three of us went to sit down with our stuff the other girl with us said to me \u201cPretty privilege is real huh? Must be rough.\u201d she was smiling when said this so I assumed it was a joke and said \u201cyeah getting things for free is so hard.\u201d We all laughed and continued with the convo. Nothing was weird or awkward at all. \n\nThen later my friend tells me that when she took the other girl home she commented on how arrogant I was and couldn\u2019t believe what I said!? I was so confused and didn\u2019t understand because we all laughed about it. My other friend said she saw where she was coming from even though the girl made the joke because I acknowledged that it was something I benefit from. \n\nIdk i\u2019m just so confused and need to AITA?", "Well, here it goes... One of my roommates has a history of using my stuff without asking. We are all in college and old enough to know not to get into other peoples' things. I noticed my toothpaste was going down really fast, so I confronted my roommate about it, and he was like \"Sorry, bro, won't do it again.\" Thing is, I've heard that line many times before. I told him I'm going to spike my toothpaste one of these days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, I made good on my promise. After I noticed my toothpaste continuing to go down, I got some very concentrated ghost pepper extract and put a decent amount near the top of my toothpaste. Well, last night I was walking down the hall, and I see my roommate bursting out of the bathroom, heading towards the kitchen. I follow him down there, and saw him downing his gallon of milk straight out of the container. I started laughing and said that now he should buy his own toothpaste. He looked at me and said \"What the fuck, dick\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe told the other roomies, and a couple thought it was hilarious what I did. The other just said I was an asshole. What's the verdict here?", "I\u2019ve been dating my girlfriend for about 6 months now, and we have been having problems for the last month or so. \n\nWe are both in our early 30\u2019s and I have known her for a few years. We dated once in our mid 20\u2019s and broke up with no contact in between. \n\nI missed her about a year ago and reached out. We started talking, meet up a few times and decided to try again. Which seemed great for awhile until we both got busy with work and life, as I started a new job. \n\nWe got into a huge blowup over commitment issues and how our relationship seemed to be falling apart. \n\nI then accused her of only sleeping with me again so soon because she wanted to get pregnant to tie me to her. \n\nShe informed me that she is not and has never been or wanted to be pregnant. \n\nMy problem with that is she slept with me again so soon after a year break. Was during our first official date, but we had seen each other several times before then. I tried to make a move while semi drunk before this, but that didn\u2019t lead to anything. \n\nHas anyone accused a non pregnant girl of trying to trap them? And I don\u2019t mean sabotaging the condoms because she never touched them. \n\nOr Am I The Asshole? ", "I just discovered the sub and this happened several years ago. Interested to hear your opinions on the matter.\n\nI had just graduated college and been out for about 6-8 months. I was looking for entry level accounts payable positions. I applied to a local dentist chain and was called in for an interview. I arrived about 10 minutes early and checked in with the secretary. During the interview process, I was always punctual and the extra few minutes gave me a little time to relax before hand. So I went to wait in the waiting room. There was no one else there.\n\nAbout half an hour goes by and I hadn't been called in. Frankly I was getting a little irked and asked the secretary if I was still scheduled. She called someone and told me they would be out momentarily. Another 15 minutes or so goes by and a couple of employees greet me walking by as I'm sitting down. I smile and politely greet them back. \n\nNot long after, the secretary takes me to a conference room. Those people who greeted me moments prior were running the interview process. They started to inquire about my background and ask typical interview questions. They had a copy of my resume but the way they were asking questions made me believe they were just reading it for the first time.\n\nI don't remember the exact exchange but they asked some question about why I was interested in working for their company and I politely responded by saying I don't think I'll be pursuing a career at the company based on how they handled my interview. I said it was okay that they were late (sometimes shit happens) but to not even keep me posted and just leave me hanging felt unprofessional. And when I mentioned that it seems like my resume hadn't even been looked at before that meeting they just sat there stone-faced like I told the truth. I told them to have a nice day and I left.\n\nI had some meh interviews before but I felt like their behavior told me all I needed to know about the company. WITA?", "My friend Laura it a mom of four children, three boys and a the youngest being a girl. Her and her husband continued having children after the first boy because they desperately wanted a little girl and we're willing to have up to six children to do that. They consider themselves luck for only having to have four. (Ages 10-1yo) \n\nSo Laura is SAHM and I work nights, when I get off I'll help her a few times a week. Going with them to the park, took the boys to a local renaissance fair so Laura would have time to herself with the baby, laser tag, etc. I enjoy doing these things and they've often said that they think of me as their Aunt, it means a lot to me because I don't have children. \n\nThe oldest boy is starting middle school at a slightly younger age and came to me for advise, I'm proud of everything he said but asked why he didn't have this talk with his mother and he said that she was more preoccupied with the baby girl.\n\nLater in the day Laura and I are relaxing and I tell her the boys issues and advice I gave and she was irritated and asked why he didn't have that moment with her, I reiterated what he said and told that it's understandable that a baby need a bit more of her time. She was visibly hurt and asked me to be completely honest with what I thought about her having multiple children. I was honest and told her I fould it selfish, she had three perfectly healthy boys in hopes that one would be a girl, she could have adopted and instead her husband works two jobs fifty hour weeks to support them but I also know that it was his choice to do this as well. She was fuming, told me I would never understand unless I was mother, and that she could never love a foster or adopted kid as much as her own, this made me cry because I'm foster kid that aged out of the system and she's aware of it. She called me as asshole for that and told me to leave.\n\nIt's been about a week and she's called me multiple time and left voicemail apologizing saying that she really needs the help with the boys. I feel like an asshole, I love them and I'm happy they we're born and feel like shit if I implyed otherwise but I'm hurt that I wasn't cared for a child and that there are so many others that won't have the chance because of that mindset. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit, best transcript I can give:\n\nMe: Hey, 10yo was talking to me earlier and having some trouble adjusting to his middle school, *repeats what he said and the advice I gave him*.\n\nL: *irritated* they why wouldn't have come my husband instead?\n\nM: I don't know about him but he said he didn't want to tell you because you're more into the baby then him. I know thats understandable because a baby needs more of you time but you should talk to him about. \n\nL: I need you to honest with me right know, do you think I should have stuck to having children?\n\nM: I think it's kind of selfish that kept trying for a girl when you have healthy boys that you haven't treated any of your boys like the same (as infants). They need you too.\n\nL: Well what else did you expect me to do? I wanted a baby girl. *Uspet raising voice*\n\nM:  You could have adopted or fostered instead your husbands working 50h week which was both of your choices. \n\nL:  You're not a mother and you'd never understand that we could never love children that aren't ours in the same way.

I turn 17 in a few months. My mom first couldn\u2019t afford to get a second bed when we first moved but i was young (9) so it didn\u2019t matter. Once I turned maybe 13-14 I started to speak up at how most kids my age at least sleeps in their own bed.\n\nLet me clarify we are in no way, shape, or form broke. My mom earns a decent amount of money every week. Each time she has an excuse as to why she can\u2019t get a bed for me. I know I might sound ungrateful but there\u2019s many reasons why I NEED my own bed at least. \n\nFor one she snores, so there\u2019s nights i\u2019m up til 4 am tossing and turning. 2, she likes to cuddle me and I do not like that. I\u2019ve told her maybe a 10-15 minutes is fine but not no 2-3 hours. She\u2019ll get angry at me and call me selfish for not wanting to hug/cuddle her. \n\nWe\u2019ve got a futon couch in the living room.

I just hate her for making me share a bed with her for almost 10 years.

We don't have a lot of expendable income.  This year we had some extra money, so I thought for Mother's Day, I would suprise her with a family necklace with our kid's birthstones in it.  The birth order of our kids would make the stones Opal, Sapphire, Sapphire.  After I start searching designs, she announces that this is what she wants for mother's day.  Since I already found a design I liked and the kids liked, I showed her in private, she says she hates it.  Fair enough, money has not been spent, I ask her to give me some ideas of what she likes.  She sends me a couple designs.  I work with the kids, try to place the stones S, O, S to give the stones variation, my oldest is upset and wants the stones to be in birth order.  I find a design that looks nice (one that she sent) and lay the stones out in birth order so my kids can feel like they designed it as well.  Order the necklace, am happy to suprise her with it.  She gets it on Mother's day, complains that the chain is too thin (no shit, it is the free chain, that can be fixed).  Then, when kids are gone, tells me she hates it, it looks like a set of blue balls and she won't wear it.  Now I am in the process of going through the return and feeling like I don't EVER want to buy her a piece of jewelry again.  AITA for being upset that she acted like it was total piece of trash?  It was not a cheap necklace and it looked good in my opinion.\n\nEdit 1:  wow.  This definitely blew up more than I ever thought it would.  It definitely has given me perspective on the whole thing and hearkens back to some communication issues that exist in our marriage.  Thanks for all the replies, there is definitely some work that needs to be done between the two of us.", "I (f) own a piercing and tattoo studio and take pride in doing things properly. For those of you who don't know, piercing guns are generally very very bad. Although most people say \"I had mine done with a gun and they are fine\", it's still a poor way of piercing as a gun forces the jewellery through the lobe causing trauma to the skin, meaning that, if you decide not to have the piercing anymore, the holes are less likely to heal and the scars will be more thick and visible. Also, you cannot properly sterilise a piercing gun, and they break/get stuck often. It's also easier to pierce with needles as you can be 100% sure of where the hole is going to go. Because of this, I always pierce with needles and make sure my staff do too. \n\nMy sister is 18 and has a 5 month old baby girl. I love my sister and my niece to death but my sister was insisting on piercing her daughter's ears, and assumed I would do it. In my studio, we don't pierce babies because of the chances of the piercings being uneven when they grow up, and simply because as the owner I don't think it's fair to pierce someone who cannot give their consent to the procedure. There's also the added issues of babies not knowing it's bad to play with new piercings, the risk of them falling asleep on the piercing and hurting it, and I've also heard of parents not cleaning the piercings properly because they're \"worried about hurting the baby\". I told my sister, when she asked when she could bring my niece in, that I would not do it. \n\nShe said that if I don't, she'll go to Claire's and get them done there. I thought she was just trying to goad me into doing it to be honest, so I rolled my eyes and that was it (we've had chats before about why piercing at Claire's is bad). The next day she messaged saying she was in the mall and she was serious, and I have ten minutes to say I'll do it.\n\nI ignored her, so she called me, we had a small fight in which she insisted I do it, or Claire's does, so I eventually agreed. \n\nShe brought my niece into my studio, and I pierced her ears. It was actually quite a smooth process but my niece obviously cried. My sister actually paid me, which surprised me, and then she left, happy she got what she wanted. \n\nI feel awful, and unprofessional. This was a couple of weeks ago and the piercings are healing well. \n\nAITA?", "Edit: thank you for all advice, support and insight! But most of all thank you for one AMAZING thread full of silly stories from when you were kids, I had a laugh! Also, I did make a post in the sub you recommended and it really helped\n\nMy husband's parents were always very dismissive about our rules.\n\n\"Give them the healthy snacks I prepared\" they give sweets\n\"Dont give him that\" gives him that\n\"No more than X amount of tv\" the entire day in front of tv\n\nEvery single time they would say \" i raised your husband this way and look how well he turned out!\" And my husband would say \"they are grandparents, they are suppose to spoil them\"\n\nWhich fine. Fair enough. My kids still followed the rules at home (though a day after they visit they would always be bratty) and I had to admit it was mostly harmless.\n\nBut they crossed the line. See, my husband's father is the type that laughs when a kid says a bad word, hits/breaks something or has a tantrum. For him it's \"cute\" when children do adult stuff. \n\nSo he taught my 6 year old son to cuss. Not just accidentally cussed in front of my son. After my kids' 3 day weekend stay he went in for some tea when he was dropping them off and suddenly went \"[Son's name] come here! Show what me and gradma taught you! Come on honey\" while grinning. I listened excitedly thinking it will be a nursery rhyme. And yeah it kinda was. A rhyme. Full of cussing, mentioning things like \"fucking strippers\", dicks, drinking vodka etc. \n\nMy FIL laughed, said he taught my husband the same thing when he was young and it was hilarious. I was fuming. I told my son to leave and I ripped my FIL a new one. Telling him that until he learns to respect my rules of raising kids he wont be allowed to see them and that this IS the last time they ignored me.\n\nWho the HELL teaches a 6 year old this kind of a thing? After I explicitly asked them multiple times to not swear in front of my kids?! Do they even realise what will happen if he says that in school in front of other kids or teachers?\n\nMy husband says we shouldnt outright ban them from seeing kids, that just a stern talking to will suffice, besides \"it's only a stupid rhyme honey\". I disagree. I think they need to understand and that if they do get banned for a bit (not permamently) it will drive the point home.\n\nSo, AITA?", "I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years. We\u2019re both in our mid-20s. For a year and 10 months, we both believed that neither of us had kids. A message from my boyfriend\u2019s sister to him 2 months ago changed that. His girlfriend from his home town was suddenly claiming that he was the father of her 6 year old son. They\u2019d split up at 18 when they\u2019d both left to go to college, and he\u2019d never heard from her again. Boyfriend\u2019s Sister had seen the old girlfriend out in the supermarket with her kid, and after a bit of small talk she just casually mentioned that Boyfriend was the father and it was \u2018probably\u2019 time for him to know. Boyfriend goes home ASAP for a paternity test, and lo and behold he is this kid\u2019s father. A very important note - before this, both of us were child-free in life and mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI left everything in my boyfriend\u2019s hands since I was never going to dictate what happens, but after one \u2018playdate\u2019 he started going on about how he couldn\u2019t wait for his son to come and visit us in our city and see the sights. I smiled and nodded, and the date was eventually decided for last week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was hell from start to finish. Highlights include me waking up to the kid refusing to get in the shower, pulling my curtain down and spraying my toiletries across the shower wall, the kid throwing any food he \u2018hated\u2019 on the ground, and when his mom asked him (at my extreme pushing) to stop pulling the leaves from my plants, he smashed my vase. The mother did nothing and my boyfriend didn\u2019t feel \u2018Dad\u2019 enough to discipline him, so I just had to deal with it (the mother made it clear she didn\u2019t want me telling her kid off for being a brat).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason I\u2019m making this post, is because of my boyfriend\u2019s insistence that we are all now a \u2018family\u2019. We were out last night with close friends and my boyfriend was telling them all about how he is loving being a dad and how he can\u2019t wait for the kid to have a little brother or sister in a few years when we\u2019re a bit more financially stable. \u2026 No. I\u2019m not a mother, and I\u2019m not a step-mother - I\u2019m a woman who dates a man who has a son, and before this the only extension I would ever have to that is being \u2018wife to a man who has a son\u2019. I said to him after that my opinion on kids had not changed, and he just scoffed and acted like I was a child saying that I liked clouds because they were fluffy. I can barely handle the kid he has now being in my life, but this sudden change in him is what is pushing me to breaking point. I confided in a friend about how I feel, and they said that I would be the one firmly in the wrong if we broke up since what\u2019s done is done and I should\u2019ve decided that if I was going to break up with him over this then it should\u2019ve been the day he found out the results of the test. I\u2019m still not sure what to do, but AITA for wanting to break up over such a big life change that has changed my partner?", "We are moving in 2 weeks, out of state because of my husband\u2019s job. My 15-year-old daughter is less than thrilled about it. We\u2019re throwing a goodbye party and she\u2019s inviting most of her class. She was going to the mall with some friends and I told her she could get a new outfit for it. I gave her my card, gave her a budget and left it at that.\n\nI checked my account later that day and realized she had spent way over budget. I went to talk to her and she admitted that she had not only gone over budget for herself, but she also bought outfits for her friends. She said \u201cDad has a new job, we can afford it.\u201d She then said they planned to do it because we were making her move. I was blown away by the entitlement, took the new outfit away and then went to one friend\u2019s house, explained what happened. They said they were going to give it back anyhow because they didn\u2019t feel comfortable accepting expensive clothes from us. \n\nI go to the second girl\u2019s house (I had called them ahead of time, mind you, I didn\u2019t ambush them) and they gave me the clothes but said they found this to be very rude. They said that these were a gift and I was taking it back. I said considering it was given without my consent, they should understand. They said their daughter was upset. I told them that they were all in on this, my daughter admitted it, to get back at us for moving, did that bother them? They didn\u2019t seem to be. Which is fine, but still, I thought they\u2019d see it from my side.\n\nI returned the clothes and got the money back. My husband things I should\u2019ve just reported the card stolen and donated her portion of the clothes, but I said it technically wasn\u2019t since I gave it to our daughter. He says it was weird to force the other girls to give up the clothes, but we paid for them.\n\nI don\u2019t know. Was I an ass here?\n\n (P.S: We are working with our daughter on being more comfortable with the move and we can\u2019t stop it. If we did, we wouldn\u2019t have a job or a means of supporting our family.)", "I'm using a throwaway here since I'm just not ready to start this discussion on the wedding subs I'm active on and I figure you guys might be a little more removed and impartial. \n\nWe are getting married in December. I have never gotten along with my future sister in law (SIL). I think she is overbearing, rude and she thrusts her views down everyone's throat whether it's the right time or not. She is also an on/off again Vegan and when she's on, she's preachy and rude but then you can find a Wendy's wrapper in her car the very next day. I think she has BPD but her family seems to tolerate it. \n\nShe is trying to start a catering company (easily the 5th business she's tried to start in the 5 years I've known her). My future MIL asked me if I would consider using SIL business so I agreed to meet with her. \n\nShe was rude from the word go. It's one of those things where everything from the words she used to the tone was just rude. She was on a vegan kick so she didn't even ask me what I wanted but claims she spent \"20 hours\" coming up with a menu that my \"southern family\" could tolerate (my family is Rancho Santa Fe...near San Diego...no idea where she got the idea we were from the south). What it looked like to me was she scratched some notes on legal pad and claimed that took her 20 hours. I told her I was really sorry but I'd always counted on having a great classic dish like Duck a l'Orange at my wedding and asked if she could accommodate. She said she would not use meat at all. I asked she'd be willing to make SOME of the Hors d'oeuvres and she said she'd consider it. I thought we were good.\n\nThat night I got a crazy angry call from my future MIL that I had pulled the rug out from my sister in law. I explained to her what had actually happened and MIL calmed down a bit but after I explained the real situation. \n\n Well now we are in full histrionic melt down with SIL and she is claiming that if I don't place my order and give her a deposit now, her business will fold. My fianc\u00e9 and MIL are caught in the middle and trying to keep the peace. I'm trying to make the point that I don't even think this \"business\" will be there in December and then we will have more family drama trying to get our money back from her. I relented and asked her how much the deposit would be and the DEPOSIT ONLY is twice as much as the total we are paying the PROFESSINAL CATERER who is making the main course. This is for some sort of vegan finger food. I asked her what the total would be and she said she didn't know until the food was prepared. I told her I was sick of her bullshit and hung up the phone. \n\nWell now since no one has ever talked to her like that, I'm the major asshole in the family. My fianc\u00e9, my MIL and of course my SIL are pissed. My future FIL is awesome and he advised me not to back down as I'm only one with the balls to counter the insanity. Since I'm getting mixed messages, am I the asshole?", "I hate to say it myself I do think my daugher is a piece of work. She works, but spends her entire salary on cats.\n\n\nNow, it's one thing to love cats, but when she spends almost all of her free time running in the streets feeding stray cats, donating money to shelters and the sick and injured and occationaly bringing cats home, you would know who pays for HER expenses. It's not like we can let her starve at home when she has no money for food. \n\n\nIronically, she also does not spend a single cent on the cats she adopted. We have 6 cats now already, and I am the one feeding and cleaning after them when my daugher is outside saving the day. Me and my partner tried to talk some sense to her several times but she would get upset and goes on and on about how she find meanings on saving animals and that we should support her if anything. \n\n\nShe is 29, turning 30 soon, and she is still living under our roof, with us paying for her expenses. While I have no idea if her life is as meaningful as she claims to be, I discussed with my partner and that we have to put this to a stop. \n\n\nWe have informed her that she has till October to find some place to rent and then she needs to go. With her salary, she should be able to sustain herself as long as she controls how she spends. When she started to protest about how hard it is to rent a place that allow pets, we dropped the final bomb that the cats stay with us, she could not afford to take care of them all anyway.\n\n\nShe had been rather miserable and blaming us for stopping her from saving more cats. She told me stories after stories about this and that cat she rescued the and they would die if she does not chip in for their surgeries. I am not having it, she should try to shoulder some real burdens when she is out there alone and paying for her own bills. Though really, if the cats she claimed she saved really die wouldn't she resent us? AITA for throwing her out like that?", "So this is a throw away account and I\u2019m on mobile. The usual. \nMe (33F) and my husband (39M) \n\nSo I\u2019m a SAHM for our 4 kids (11M) (9F) (5F) (4M)it was only 2  years ago  I was able to start staying with them full time when my husband got promoted. Even though we can afford for me to stay home we still do have to budget for our monthly expenses . This involved pretty much cutting out eating out entirely which left me cooking at home. \n\nI\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve taken this with stride and i have pretty much a set budget and a decent amount of key recipes that all my kids will eat with little fuss while staying in budget. I can prep lunches for my husband and our two oldests. All relatively easily. \n\nBut my husband recently went on a \u2018journey\u2019 with food. He\u2019s been vegetarian for about a year which was fine because everyone else just got a little extra meat on their plate. \n\nHe\u2019d been talking about going vegan for a while now and how everyone he follows online says it\u2019s changed their liv s and how they\u2019ve feel they\u2019ve made a difference blah blah blah\n\nNow I\u2019m supportive but I tell him I can\u2019t do it. The three youngest barley touch the food I make now and the oldest are somehow even pickier . I can\u2019t introduce a whole new menu for just him (the budget would be the same). Besides I\u2019m inexperienced with vegan food. My \u201csignature dish\u201d is lasagna with beef and cheese up the wahoo\u2019\n\nI tell him this and he blows up how I\u2019m an asshole for not trying and I\u2019m part of the problem blindly supporting the meat industry and what\u2019s the point of him working so much so I can stay home if I can\u2019t even do this for him\n\nI don\u2019t want to waste a whole grocery trip on food the kids and I won\u2019t like. But he\u2019s not an unreasonable man who would demand something that he didn\u2019t truly believe in so AITA?\n\nEdit: sort by Q&a", "I'm not American. Pardon my English.\n\nI had my eldest daughter at 16 with my high school girlfriend who was 19. I wanted to have a family anf yes, I was really dumb.\n\nWe  got married really young, but we got divorced because I found out that she was sleeping another man who was much older. He had the money, I was not financially secure. She got custody and I got visitation. This continued for a while, but he had the money to pamper my daughter and my finances were not that great. By the time she was 14, idk what happened, but my daughter opted for optional visitation. It simply meant that I could only see her if she wanted to see me. That never happened. \n\nAround that time, I was just starting to do well for myself and I decided to move away because I could no longer take it. I had to accept the fact that she didn't want to see. I tried to contact my ex for information and pictures but I was simply told that I was infringing on their privacy. Eventually I gave up and I moved on.\n\nI just understood that I had to be financially strong. I concentrated on my real estate business that and I did really well for myself. It's been years now and I'm really happy. I own a very successful real estate firm and I'm married now with a daughter. I owe everything to my wife and my best friend who were really supportive. \n\nWhen my eldest daughter was starting college, my ex contacted me and told me that she was divorced. She asked me if I would help with my daughter's college expenses. I gladly helped because I no longer had any financial woes. I also gave her a graduation present ( a lump sum to get her started ). \n\nSo she surprised me with a party yesterday. And she was there. She's 25 now. 25. We had a chat. She apparently missed me so much. She was sorry and she never knew that the money came from me. I call bullshit on that. I told her it was not an attempt to reconcile and I was only doing my duty and walked out. \n\nWife tells me that my daughter deserved a chance and I had to take the high road. But it's just too much for me. It's beyond repair and serves no purpose. AITA here.\n\nEdit: Someone messaged me asking to mention when my daughter graduated. She graduated when she was 22.\n\nEdit2: This is not about my daughter wanting money from me. And I personally don't think that she's only doing this because I'm well off now, because my firm is well known where I live and it's not a secret she just stumbled upon. It's just that I've missed her ENTIRE CHILDHOOD. What is there to do now. I have no memories with my daughter. And I don't know if it changes much now.\n\nEdit3: Party was father's day stuff with family.", "A little bit of a background. I live in a high rise and pay $160 per month for 2 parking spots in the connected parking garage. I have adjoining spots which is incredibly rare in my building. I live by myself currently, and I have a wide truck that I currently park centered over the line on my double spot to leave room for the people's doors next to me.\n\nThe parking spot next to me is on the end of the row on a corner, which admittedly can get quite tight at times. They usually park close to the line on my side to give the drivers in the garage more room. Up until now I've been fine with giving them a little leeway, however we have never spoken.\n\nPreviously they have done little things that make me think they're a bit pretentious: They have left items in my spot that I have had to move out of the way in order to park. The drive the wrong way in the parking garage to get to their spot 5 seconds quicker. This past week It looks like they disabled the light above their spot due to the spider issue in our garage, and they put the cover pieces in my spot. Again, nothing too bothersome, just weird to me someone does stuff like that that.\n\nWell last night this person apparently decides my spot is now their spot, and they park with more than 60% of their car over the dividing line between our two spots. It is so egregiously over the line, there is no way this is a simple mistake. It just so happens that last night I was planning on using both of my spots for the first time in quite a while. I get building security involved, and they contact the owner to get the car moved. It is now the next day and the car has not been moved yet.\n\nI wanted to nip this in the bud, because I don't want anyone else to feel entitled to my spot. About an hour after I was told the owner had been contacted, I went down to move my car, and found the car still there. I was angry and feeling petty so I parked my car about 8 inches from their driver's side mirror, but I am still well within my own parking spots. I posted a picture of the car with the license plate obscured to our building's very active NextDoor page effectively saying \"whoever uses spot X please move your car, you are in my spot\".\n\nIf for some reason this continues past this evening I want to escalate. My building, per our bylaws, has to the right to impose fines to residents who do not abide by the rules, and I want to ask them to charge the offender the cost of my rent for the parking spot per day they have used it. It works out to about $2.50 per day. I have also been told that towing the offending car is an option as well, but I'll only use that as a last resort.\n\nOnce the car is moved, I will also start parking entirely in my spot directly next to them, regardless of if I will be parking two cars or not. I feel I need to set boundaries now, but AITA for taking it this far?", "Howdy, y\u2019all. \n\nSo about a year ago, these 3 gals moved into an apartment in our building. We actually moved from that unit, to another in the same building. The ended up pushing their move-in date a week earlier, and bringing their parents to make demands on their behalf, but were generally polite despite requiring we suddenly clean up a week early for them. \n\nSince then, they\u2019ve taken to ignoring us on the street. We\u2019ve all just tried to be neighborly, but have since given up wasting time on it. The building is in a more expensive part of town, quite \u201cunique,\u201d and the rent is incredibly low. So \u201cit is what it is\u201d has become the motto for this dilapidated gem. Now, about the note...\n\nIt\u2019s their first apartment. They\u2019ve had issues with taking out trash for nearly their entire time here. While there are cans on the roof, most of us just go ahead and take our trash down to the dumpster. The place is owned by an older couple, and having the husband drag our trash all the way downstairs is something we and other tenants would prefer to avoid. Besides, there\u2019s much more important work to be done around the place. \n\nBut these gals can\u2019t even be bothered to bring their trash outside. They just let it pile up outside their door, inside the building, and stink begins to fester. So the owner eventually hauls it all the way outside and downstairs himself. I found him doing this one day, fumed over it for the night, and we wrote a note the next morning. It read;\n\n>\t\u201cLook-\n    Leaving your garbage up here is *trashy*. Leaving it up here to rot & stink up the building is disgusting. But- making it such a problem that other people have to take care of it is **fucking shameful**. Get your shit together, ladies. \nSincerely,\n  Who cares, take care of **your** shit.\u201d\n\n\n\nI feel kinda bad. The wording was strong. But the trash is gone. AITA?", "My wife and I were taking an early morning flight out for a mini vacation.  As we were about to sit at our assigned seats, we saw a service member in uniform sitting in my wife\u2019s window seat (I had the middle).  Since it was the first flight out, we wanted to get a little sleep, but my wife really can\u2019t sleep on a plan unless she\u2019s at the window.  Plus, we paid around $600.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we approached our seats, he was already snuggled in the seat as if he was also going to get some sleep as well.  When I asked if he was in the correct seat (even though I knew he wasn\u2019t), he said, \u201cDo you mind if I just sit here?\u201d with a very smug look on his face.  It was as if he assumed I would say yes.  I kindly said no.  He then replied, \u201cAre you sure? You can have the aisle.\u201d  I turned to my wife to see what she thought, and she shook her head to say no.  So again, I said no thanks.  After that I heard a couple of other passengers say to just let him sit there.  He just stared at me after that and still didn\u2019t move.  Maybe he was expecting that I would give in after hearing those comments.  I then sternly asked him to please sit in his assigned seat.  He finally complied but was obviously annoyed.  I overhead those other passengers saying I should\u2019ve let him sit there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel as if he was using the fact that he was in the military to his advantage by the way he responded.  I can only assumed he has done this before since he was so smug.  However, maybe he was finally coming home after some time away from home and was tired.  I felt a little guilty, but also couldn\u2019t forget how smug he was.  Also, I fly quite a bit for work and have never had anyone defend someone else who was sitting in the wrong seat.  I assume it was because he was in the military.  Anyway, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm pretty sure he was Army since we were flying out of SeaTac and JBLM is close.  There were several other uniformed service members on the flight.  He didn't look young enough to be fresh out of boot camp.  I think maybe he was 20.  I don't know what rank he was.  I'm not familiar with how to identify that.  And for the people who think this story is fake, I forgot to mention that everyone on the plane, including the pilots, stood up from their seats and clapped once he moved seats.\n\n&#x200B;", "I was born with a rare neuromuscular disease called Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT).

She says her IQ is above 140.\u201d  This seemed a bit suspicious to me, since after years of knowing her, I would never have guessed she had even an above average IQ.  Not that people without higher education couldn\u2019t have a high IQ, but just knowing she got her GED at age 19 or 20, and had not gone to college, both seemed a bit odd... but mainly after years of knowing her, I know she\u2019s not super smart (which is totally ok! Not bashing her at all, she\u2019s an awesome person, I\u2019m just being honest.)\n\nSome background - my brother is a professional clinical psychologist, whose sole job is to test the IQ of children in the schools that hire him (you know, since IQ tests are actually made for children, not adults). Since we\u2019re brothers and best friends, I have had years of correspondence with him throughout his schooling and career, and so I\u2019ve become at least basically familiar with how legitimate IQ tests work.\n\nSo I asked my friends if they knew who tested her, what type /version of IQ test was it, etc. but no one really knew. So a little later, I got around to talking to her, and found a way to bring it up in conversation.  She told me it was an IQ test she found online, through a link on Facebook or something, but couldn\u2019t remember the exact name of the website (but confirmed it wasn\u2019t Mensa).  I asked her if they bombarded her with ads to subscribe to their \u201chigh IQ society\u201d or whatever and she was like, \u201coh yeah they did! I signed up for a month and then cancelled...\u201d \n\nAt this point, I realized this was one of those online phishing things, where they give you relatively easy IQ test-esque questions, flatter you with the results, and hope to coax you into giving them money.  I remember taking one of those tests back when I was a teenager surfing online, and even then it was immediately obvious to me that I probably shouldn\u2019t conclude that I have a high IQ based on a sketchy web app.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though - since taking this test, and absolutely believing the results, it has had a real impact on her life. Since \u201clearning she\u2019s a genius,\u201d she got laid off from her desk job, but then went on to start her own self-employed business as an interior decorator, and is doing really well with it. Talking with her boyfriend, he said that she\u2019s had so much more conviction and confidence since taking the test, and I\u2019ve deduced that she may not have ever thought she was capable of starting her own business and following her dreams, had she not been lead to suddenly believe she was a genius.\n\nThe problem is, I didn\u2019t put those pieces together while at my friends\u2019 house.  I thought it would be better for her to know the truth... so I pulled up one of these type of IQ test websites on my phone, chock full of pop-up ads, redirected windows, etc.... all the telltale signs of a phony site. She confirmed that they looked like the test she took, so I was like, \u201cYeah that wasn\u2019t a real IQ test...\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t think it was a big deal in the moment, like so what you were fooled by a phony test, but she\u2019s doing well in life and I couldn\u2019t imagine that news having any affect on her outlook on life.  But now I\u2019m pretty sure it was somewhat devastating to her... my friend who\u2019s dated her for 10+ years asked me about what I said to her later that night, seemed a little pissed off, and since has been pretty much silent with me (ignoring my texts, but responding to everyone else in group texts, etc). So I\u2019ve surmised that this is kind of a big deal to his girlfriend.  Haven\u2019t heard anything from her about it since, but at least we did receive their save-the-date for their wedding this summer, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re cutting me out of their lives completely...\n\nTLDR: AITA for breaking the news to my friends gf that the online IQ test that told her she\u2019s a genius was phony, but later realized that it\u2019s probably because of that IQ test that she\u2019s made great positive changes in her life?\n\nEdit, added info: I personally haven\u2019t heard her brag about her high IQ, but apparently it is something she\u2019s done before, especially when she\u2019s drunk at parties.  I can\u2019t personally say it is bad enough that she deserves to be knocked down a peg, but it\u2019s not like she was very humble about it...\n\nEdit 2: Inspired by people\u2019s responses, I texted my friend\u2019s brother (also one of my best friends) about it, since he\u2019s the one who first told me about her IQ and is very aware of the awkward situation (he thinks the whole thing is hilarious, totally isn\u2019t helping lol).  But I asked him AITA and he said he was really glad when I told her because she had been annoying about it in the past, especially when she first took the test. He said she would hang it over her Bfs head when they argued (they constantly fight), and he said he\u2019s surprised his brother is mad instead of happy that I told her.  He also said he doesn\u2019t think they really care all that much about the whole thing, haven\u2019t brought it up in conversations (they\u2019re close), I might be overthinking it now, and thinks it\u2019ll blow over soon\n\nEdit 3: Correction - I didn\u2019t mean to say that there are no IQ tests for adults & adolescents, I meant that IQ tests were invented originally & are used primarily for diagnosing children. \n\nAlso - thanks all for the lively debate! Going to see this group of friends next weekend, will draw from all this input when I try to make things right.", "So my husband and I were stuck in an airport for 15 hours yesterday due to multiple flights to our destination being delayed and cancelled, so we hung out at a lot of different charging stations. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis lady had her phone on top of someone else\u2019s phone in her group on the charging station. Apparently she had set an alarm thing on her phone to go off if someone moves it because she left it unattended on the charging station. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we got to the charging station at our terminal the alarm was going off already and apparently the lady had walked away to do something and someone else in her group was holding it and the alarm was just constantly going off and sounded like a car alarm. Me and my husband were trying to figure out what was making this noise. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo when she comes back from the bathroom, she\u2019s yelling at her husband \u201cwtf why is my phone going off?! Who touched it?!?!\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nSo she looks over at me and my husband with the nastiest face assuming we fucked with her phone, which we did not. I do not care to mess with other people\u2019s stuff. She was just yelling and going on and on about someone touching her phone, very loudly and angrily. For a good solid 10 minutes, constantly bitching. \n\n\n\n\n\nHer husband tells her someone bumped it while trying to get their phone plugged in to this station. And she just gets even madder still yelling about people trying to take her shit, which nobody did. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo she comes to the station, moves other people\u2019s shit around to get her phone plugged back in and she puts that damn car alarm trigger back on it, so if it moves, it goes off very loudly. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to start boarding she\u2019s waiting at the desk, even though she was in the last boarding group. She was in such a hurry to try to cut every other boarding group, I guess she forgot about her heavily secured phone on the charging station. \n\n\n\n\n\nHer husband tells her, this isn\u2019t our group you can\u2019t board and she just shrugs her shoulders and stays in the line. My husband and I are still by the charging station because our boarding group was next to last. I unplug my phone and notice hers is still plugged in. She\u2019s near the front of the line at this point. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019m not touching that thing to make it go off very loudly again and have her accuse me of stealing her shit, yet again, just to take it to her and line cutting husband. She was complaining very loudly about god knows what to the people at the boarding gate so I just decided to leave it, thinking maybe she\u2019d remember but I honestly don\u2019t know if she ever did. \n\n\n\n\n\nDoes this make me an asshole?\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT TO ADD: I 100% don\u2019t even know if she actually ended up forgetting it. I did see her for a brief moment in crossing when we landed and she didn\u2019t seem angry. So there could be a big chance she did go back for it. I just didn\u2019t remind her to do so.", "My grandfather is a racist homophobic asshole.  I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\n**Edit**:  So a couple people have mentioned getting in touch with the cousin that was kicked out.  I am currently unable to find him to contact him.  He went dark after he left and cut the entire family out of his life and I don't blame him for lumping me in with them.  As for charitable donations this is something I had already considered awhile ago.  There is a  local non profit for helping LGBT teens get on their feet after being kicked out by bigoted families that I feel is a perfect candidate.  They will absolutely be receiving a donation, though I will probably keep it anonymous just to avoid drama should other family find out.", "My wife and I are both Canadian. I just had a business trip to Geneva and my wife wanted me to get some chocolate from a place she found online. In particular, their chocolate truffles are apparently really famous so she wanted me to bring back a bunch. Despite this bakery being a 1hr 30 minute commute each way from where I'm staying, ofcourse I oblige to make my wife happy.\n\nUnfortunately when I arrive they're sold out of said truffles, but still have a wide variety of chocolate goodies to choose from. Not wanting to disappoint my wife, I buy a bunch of said chocolate to bring home, way more than the truffles she originally asked for.\n\nWhen I get home and explain the truffle situation, she isn't appreciative of what I brought. She says she doesn't want the chocolate and questioned whether I went to the right place, if I looked hard enough, etc etc. Honestly felt a bit fed up since I really went out of my way to get her this and she doesn't even say thanks.\n\nAnyway to cut a long story short, since she said she didn't want the chocolate I went to my neighbors and gave it all to their daughters (9 and 11). They were really happy and it made me feel a bit better. When my wife finds out I gave away *her* chocolate she blows her lid and demands I get her some more to make it up to her.\n\nObviously I am a bit biased here so asking for an unbiased asshole judgment. If I'm an asshole I'll bite my tongue and get her more chocolate.", "Basically, I am a doctor who graduated from one of the top med schools in the country. Because of this, I know what it takes to make it as a doctor. My eldest daughter is also on a medical track: she goes to a top 20 school and is excelling. She is a junior, and will probably get into one of the best med schools next year. \n\nMy youngest daughter is not like us. For my eldest daughter and I, math and science come more naturally. It\u2019s not something we need to work hard at. My youngest daughter, however, really struggles with these topics. In college, she has to study for her STEM classes for hours and hours just to get the average grade at a school that\u2019s not very difficult. \n\nMy daughter, to her credit, is a VERY hard worker and I admire that. However, that hard work could be placed to a field that she can really excel in instead of being a doctor; she will always struggle in med school, but she can take her talents elsewhere and become an amazing law or business major.  \n\nThe drama is that she called me yesterday and told me she had trouble getting accepted with an internship, and asked if she could work with me this summer. I basically told her she should reconsider the medical professions because she spends all day studying and she is barely average, and I don\u2019t think she can succeed as a doctor. BUT I reassured her that it\u2019s okay and she can find something else to shine in. On the phone she was really quiet, and I ended the phone call with \u201cI love you\u201d. After this, I have my eldest daughter, ex-husband, mother, and siblings spamming me and telling me to apologize. Youngest won\u2019t even pick up the phone. \n\nI understand that her feelings may have been hurt and while that\u2019s valid, I think tough love will help her in the future. For example, it may have hurt her feelings when she was younger because I wouldn\u2019t let her eat cookies for dinner, but as a parent you need to protect your children, even when it hurts them in the short term. \n\nTl;dr: Told daughter she won\u2019t succeed as a doctor, now everyone is mad. AITA?", "My daughter came to me at 17 and said she was pregnant. It was a huge shock and I was disappointed (we had safe sex talks, I put her on the pill, etc.) but we made it through. When my granddaughter was born, I helped my daughter and her boyfriend as much as I could. I was always told that her birth control failed and that\u2019s why she got pregnant.\n\nFast forward a year later and they\u2019re pregnant once again, \u201cbirth control failure\u201d. I was suspicious but my daughter swore up and down she was taking her pills and I was picking them up from the pharmacy for her, so it shouldn\u2019t have been a problem. \n\nI guess I wasn\u2019t the only one suspicious. Her boyfriend started doing some snooping and one day, I come home to find he\u2019s gone, and he took the baby. My daughter is a wreck. I ask what happened. She said that he\u2019s accusing her of getting pregnant both times on purpose, is calling her crazy and wants full custody of both kids. I got her to calm down and asked her a few times if he was right about her getting pregnant on purpose. She finally confessed. She admitted to just not taking her birth control the months she wanted to conceive, and flushing them.\n\nI have never been more pissed. These pregnancies have caused our family to go into a state of disarray. We had to rearrange our whole lives. I love my grand baby but life is ten times harder. I was so angry with her, I told her that she had to go stay with her grandmother for a bit (after calling to see if she\u2019d take her) or if she didn\u2019t want to go there, anywhere else. She asked how long a bit was and I said I wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nIt\u2019s been a couple of weeks. I know her boyfriend has let her see the baby and they\u2019re working out custody, but that\u2019s just from my mom. My husband says we should let her move back in but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so angry with her right now. It was one thing when it was an accident but she did it on purpose. She\u2019ll be 19 soon, so legally we don\u2019t have to, but my husband feels it\u2019s right. He says we can\u2019t kick her out over this but I feel like I can\u2019t be around her.\n\nAITA for kicking her out?", "Son got himself a girlfriend about 6/7 months ago, I have no complaints about the girl, she's nice enough. He brought her home to meet me and my wife, everything was fine. My issue with it is that 2 weeks ago he announced that he would ask her to marry him. I thought to myself that he just had this plan for the future but he informed us that he wants to do it by next month.\n\nMy wife was over the moon with the news but I wasn't in the least. I told him that I don't believe this will work because they barely know each other, not only that but they're completely opposites. The girl is outgoing and charismatic while my son barely has enough friends, she makes him look like a dead weight not to mention that she's completely out of his league. Of course he got mad at this and so did my wife.\n\nNow I found out that he won't be visiting us anymore and my wife has decided by herself that she will be visiting him instead. I don't see how it was wrong for me to give my opinion, it was just that, an opinion. I'm not going to get in the way of him marrying the girl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Ok I get, I'm an asshole, I peaked at highschool, I'm jealous of my son.... The list goes on. But I'm still right that he's being stupid and I hope that you all have an asshole on your lives so when you think about doing stupid shit like marrying someone you barely know they at least try and give you some perspective.", "I'm a 30 year old white woman with EXTRAORDINARILY curly hair - think Merida in the Disney movie Brave. In high school, my best friend (who is black) showed me how to wrap my hair when it's curly to avoid it frizzing out. It has been an absolute game changer for me, and I never really thought much of it. Recently, we somehow got on the topic during a chat at work. One of the (black) women there made a comment about how me appropriating African culture like that is a totally racist move. I generally have a great relationship with this woman, so this whole thing kind of threw me sideways. I never thought about it that way, and honestly just thought that she was blowing it out of proportion, but when I asked a few other women, they agreed that IATA here and that I need to a) apologize and b) stop doing it. AITA?\n\nEDIT: For clarification, I mean wrapping it in like a silk cloth at night to sleep in. Nothing goes out in public, and the only people who see it are my husband and the Postmates guy. I would totally get her point if I was doing this at work, but this is a bedtime-only thing.", "When I was a small child, my grandfather gave me a small teapot because I thought it was very pretty and I was the only girl. He died two years later, but it stayed in my mother's house until my parents passed away a few years ago. This was my teapot and I collected it from the house. My siblings and I split the rest of the estate equally. The teapot was \"just a trinket\" and not included.\n\nMy husband and I recently found out that the teapot was actually much older and much more valuable than we ever thought. It's worth over 500k, which is over 50x what all us kids got from the estate.\n\nMy siblings are furious that I got a \"windfall\" and that this money should also be split equally. I don't want to. I can put all of my kids through college now and pay off our house, which is what we're going. I feel that the teapot was mine and was always mine (and not part of family money). I don't think they have a claim. \n\nAITA here?", "A friend of mine(or so I thought) is getting married soon to his long time gf and for whatever reason I am the lone man out.\n\nMe and this guy weren't just acquaintances, we were friends and all of our friends are best friends. We lived together, we partied together, and I helped him at any moment he has needed it(big or small). Not only that but me and his brother are really close too.\n\nSo it's odd to me that all of our friends are not just invited but are his best men. I don't even get an invite. In fact, forget the invite, he's never to my face said he's actually getting married and neither has his gf who I thought I was cool with but I think now I know im not.\n\nI can't even hang out with my boys right now because they are all excited for this big thing in my friends life and they talk about all the fun they are going to have etc at his wedding. I just end up leaving because it ends up making my blood boil and everyone is just ignoring the fact that I don't even matter enough for a \"hey I'm getting married, sorry I can't fit everyone in.\"\n\nWIBTA for cutting my losses and taking the hint? The only thing is when I cut people off I completely cut them off so I might lose others because of this too but I feel like the disrespect is eating away at me. It hurts that I invest so much into my friends and someone doesn't even have the balls to tell me to my face that I'm not invited(which I was fine with for a while).\n\nAll I ever do is try to make sure my team is always on the up and up but it feels like I get taken advantage of way too often and I put up with it. Maybe I'm overreacting and I'm making this about me during a crucial time in his life.\n\nEDIT: The only explanation I have ever gotten was from a friend who is also really close and he mentioned he thinks his fiance doesn't like me that much.\n\n\n\n**Update:** So I just called him thanks to everyone who said I should talk to him. I probably should not have talked to him because I would have been happier where I was at. \n\nHe was driving to work so had a short talk but wow did things just change fast right now. I bluntly asked him what's going on because I wanted clarity into this whole thing and I told him I felt disrespected to not even be told about the wedding. He basically said he knows and he felt sorry about it. I asked why and he said his fiance basically has held some sort of grudge with me ever since the first time she met me back when we were freshmen in college. Mind you this is basically 6 years ago. She apparently didn't like the fact I wasn't \"giving her the time of day\". At that time in our lives my buddies had new girl friends monthly. I rarely ever got to know most of them because none of them ever lasted long. She did last long and eventually(like 6 months after they were together) I made an effort to really get to know her because I realized she was sticking around. I wasn't ever ignoring her ever but our conversations would be super surface level before that. \n\nAccording to him she thinks I'm fake or pretend to be friendly to her just because shes with my friend. So she chose to cross me off the invitation list when they were making last edits and he went along with it. He had no reply to why he couldn't just tell me. He said he was about to park and go into work so I had to end our call there. \n\nI hope he has more to say than that because it sounds like he didn't even stick up for me over something so petty.\n\n\nTHANK YOU EVERYONE. I got what I need here. Vented, got answers, and realized I need a vacation. I know the perfect weekend.\n\nSecondary update after speaking to another friend and telling him what happened. He mentioned that my buddy is jealous of me and has been for a long time. Makes no sense to me. I don\u2019t flash money(I do enjoy having finer things and eating well though). I always share what I can too. I\u2019m not rich. I work hard and have my own business but I make decent money. I love without having major financial worries.\n\nI hope for his sake that this is not the real reason because this is worse.", "Seeing the buzz around WoW Classic, I felt some intense nostalgia and decided to log into my Blizzard/WoW account after a\u00a0 7+ year absence. After some issues logging in and a Blizzard support ticket, I found out that my account has been in use during my 7+ year hiatus.\u00a0\n\nFound out one of my ex friends who somehow had access to my account when I quit has been using it since I quit. I can see the transaction history of his payments for subscriptions. I decided to change the password, phone number, email, contact details, payment methods,\u00a0 security questions, etc. as well as add the authentication feature.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s where I feel conflicted: He created new characters in various realms and leveled them to 120 with tons of gold and items. He still kept my old main characters roughly where they were at when I quit,\u00a0 but he did strip them of gold and deleted or transferred some of my old characters.\u00a0Or at least changed their names/races or transferred servers.\n\nI do not know this guy anymore, like at all: have not talked to him in years, he doesn\u2019t know my phone number, we\u2019re not connected on any social media, and I live in a new state. Should I try to reach out to him and offer to transfer his characters? I admit it\u2019s kind of a dick move to take over this account but he did it to me first, without my consent. FYI, My name was actually still on the account for the first & last name! \n\nI vaguely remember logging into my account at his house. It's possible I may of even allowed him to play my characters in the time period between quitting but with my subscription still active for a few more weeks. It's been so long it's kind of difficult to know for certain. To be clear: I do NOT remember giving him explicit permission to use my account in entirety or mess around with my characters", "Some back story: My mother has always had this weird anger toward my sex life. Which, quite frankly.. I believe is not any of her business now that I\u2019ve moved out. She\u2019s called me a slut in the past many times before, made me cry as she called me disgusting, over and over again. You get it. She still seems to always be so curious about it though. Maybe worried, which I understand. But, it never ends well for the both of us. Just conflict.\n\nThe reason for her anger I believe is because for one, I am still young (19). I am her *daughter*, and I am extremely sexually active. No strings attached. Multiple partners. You could understand why she called me a whore. I sleep around. But, I\u2019m not in a relationship.. if that helps anything. If I was, I think it\u2019d be a different story.\n\n\nOn the other hand, she\u2019s always let me in on her relationship with her current boyfriend, from which she\u2019s cheated on several times. She\u2019s never seemed to feel guilty about it at all. She in fact boasted about it, the times it happened. \n\n\nShe also is constantly talking shit about me to her boyfriend - something that she tells me from time to time. Don\u2019t know why. \n\nShe once told me, and I quote, \u201cOh.. and. I told him by the way. About how you\u2019re sleeping with so many guys again. I\u2019m sure even he thinks you\u2019re a slut.\u201d \n\nAnyway. The whole scenario went down like this. And, sorry for the format issues. I\u2019m on mobile. \n\nWe were sitting at my dinner table. Having a great time. She invited herself and her boyfriend over, offered to cook dinner. I thought it was sweet. Sure. I have no problems with the guy. \n\n\nHe jokingly asks, \u201cYou having fun living alone now? Hahahah. How many guys have you had over?\u201d\n\nI sarcastically replied with, \u201cJust a few.\u201d\n\nMaybe it was my fault for thinking this kind of joke would slide past my mom. And, it wasn\u2019t even a joke. I was being honest. But, I tried to make it seem like one. \n\nAt this point she\u2019s infuriated. \u201cAre you kidding me? Already? Wow. Just wow. You are a whore.\u201d\n\nOuch. In my own house? Really. And, in front of the boyfriend? Jeez. It\u2019s like she was asking for it. It might\u2019ve been best to apologize and lie to her. But, I couldn\u2019t do it. She disrespected me. She\u2019s been disrespecting me. And, the thing that pissed me off the most was that she\u2019s a hypocrite. The audacity she had to call me that in front of her boyfriend baffled me.\n\nGlancing at her boyfriend, and back at her I said,  \u201cBut you aren\u2019t so innocent though either. How can you say that to me?\u201d\n\nIt was like throwing gasoline into a fire. She almost got physical. Yelling gibberish. \u201cHow dare you speak to me like that, I am your fucking mother.\u201d Over and over again. \u201cGet your shit (boyfriend\u2019s name) we\u2019re leaving. C\u2019mon.\u201d\n\nHasn\u2019t spoken to me since. It\u2019s been 3 days. \n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: Some people are questioning why I never told my mother\u2019s boyfriend about the cheating until now, and how it was cruel, why I never brought it up before, how I used it as a weapon, etc. which I think is a very valid point. I posted a comment but I will repost it here:\n\nI have also been reading the comments about why I never told my mother\u2019s boyfriend. It is really a good point. My reasoning though is, I just recently moved out of my mother\u2019s house. I felt like I could finally stand up for myself and point the finger back. It might have been cruel - yes, the timing. But, I would have never had the guts to tell her boyfriend, and have her realize I was the one who told him - me being the only one who knows that information - whilst living under her roof. I\u2019ve thought of it before, but.. I was honestly just too scared. I can totally agree with me being the asshole here though for that specific point.", "Throwaway because I'm pretty sure I'm the asshole in the situation.\n\nI dated \"Sara\" from 2014 to 2016 (just under 2 years total). Looking back on it, she was emotionally abusive, and absolutely manipulative. To keep things short: she treated me poorly and I was a doormat. I learned a ton from that experience, and have since reflected on that relationship as a period where I emerged with serious personal growth and  much more self respect.\n\nThe relationship ended when she cheated on me. She broke up with me, and I literally never saw her again. Immediately after the breakup, I blocked her on EVERYTHING, deleted pictures, etc. The relationship was a mess and that's how I decided to move on. I literally haven't even seen a picture of her since the day we broke up. \n\nSo, fast forward to today, 3+ years since we broke up. I get a call from an unknown number. Normally I wouldn't answer, but I'm waiting to hear back from some job applications, so answered. To my surprise, it was Sara's mom. \n\nI was confused, but politely asked her why she was contacting me. She goes on to inform me that Sara was killed in a car accident a few days prior, and that she was letting me know. She said that Sara's funeral would be in a few days and told me where it is being held. \n\nI told her that I am so sorry for her loss. I offered my condolences, but told her I wouldn't be attending the funeral. She got very upset and asked me why. I told her that our relationship didn't end well, and that it felt inappropriate overall. \n\nHer mom got increasingly upset, and said that she was hoping I'd say a few words at her funeral. I was shocked. I asked if she knew why we had broken up. Apparently, Sara had told her family that I had gotten a job elsewhere and we ended things amicably, and that she thought we remained in touch. I informed her that we broke up because she had cheated on me, and that I hadn't spoken to her in years. I kept trying to end the call, but she was very upset and I felt horrible; she had just lost her daughter. I was very uncomfortable and said something I shouldn't have. After a minute or two more of back and forth, I said \"Look, I didn't have anything nice to say about her when she was alive, and I don't have anything nice to say about her now. I won't be attending.\" \n\nI realize how insensitive that was, but I didn't know how else to convey what I was feeling. I'm not happy she's dead, I'd never wish that on anyone. But the fact of the matter is, her death didn't make me feel good or bad. It has no impact on my life at all. \n\nI've been getting messages from some of her friends (who I also haven't spoken to in years) because apparently her mom is now telling people I'm shit-talking her dead daughter. They aren't part of my social circle so there's really no backlash, but it didn't feel great to read their messages. I absolutely won't be going to the funeral, but I'm wondering if I should reach out and apologize to her mom.", "I\u2019ll try to keep it short and simple. My girlfriend is a little chubby, but she\u2019s gorgeous. I love her body even though she\u2019s really self conscious about it. No matter how much I try to reassure her, she doesn\u2019t care for my opinion. As she\u2019s told me, her opinion of herself is what matters. \n\nAnyway, whenever we go on vacations she gets depressed when I send her our photos (I\u2019m the designated photographer). But I noticed that she\u2019s very happy when she looks \u201cthin\u201d from certain angles or clothing, and thinks more fondly of the memory. So slowly, I started photoshopping all of her photos to make her look thinner. As a result, she\u2019s not as distracted during our vacations or worries about how she\u2019ll look when we take photos. \n\nAITA here for doing this without telling her? Should I tell her at this point or would it just make things worse?\n\nEdit: Okay well.. am I less of an asshole if I note that the photoshopped version of her is how I see her in person? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fat at all. Photos just don\u2019t always do her justice and I think it\u2019s unfair for her to judge herself based on bad angles.", "Background: When I was 11, my dad and mom split. My dad got a new girlfriend and he hasn\u2019t really been around much. I\u2019ll invite him to volleyball games or other school activities and he wouldn\u2019t show and make up some excuse that usually had to do with his girlfriend. He has missed every birthday since I was 11 because something up with his girlfriend. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true but he always used his girlfriend as an excuse. So my dad isn\u2019t really part of my life anymore.\n\nI am now 17 years old. Recently, my dad decided to come around. Father\u2019s girlfriend is pregnant and that my be why but IDK. He came over while mom was at work and walked in on my BF and I having sex. Mom is ok with us having sex since she knows that she can\u2019t stop it but wants us to tell her when it happens so she can make sure we have enough condoms and stuff to stay safe. He yelled at us to get dressed and come downstairs. He then kicked my boyfriend out and sat me down at the kitchen table to scream at me some more. I couldn\u2019t get a word in edgewise. After being screamed at for about 30 MINUTES, I snapped. I yelled at him that he has not been a part of my life for almost 6 years. Hasn\u2019t even made an effort to give a damn birthday card on my birthday. He doesn\u2019t get to all of a sudden decide to become a parent again whenever he feels like it. I told him to get the hell out and leave me alone.\n\nAfter that, he called my mom and told her what happened. She came home and scolded me for talking that way to my father and that I should apologize.\n\nAITA for snapping at my dad that he doesn\u2019t have the right to parent me anymore?\n\nEDIT: He doesn\u2019t have a key to my moms house. We have a spare key in a fake rock that I use when I forget my keys. He saw me use the spare key one night when he came over for dinner. Mom was grocery shopping and she was running late for dinner. I had forgotten my bag in another dancer\u2019s car after dance class.", "UPDATE 3: Lots of YTA intitially, NTA afterwards, Just clarifying 1 thing, this was checked by commentators below for the app I used, Indeed I did pay Per Hour, Not Per Room or Sq ft. Im not making that up or lying and if you see the name below you can check for yourself.\n\n(Repost letter count)\ntldr: I hired a cleaner for a certain number of hours, i lied about the size of the house because i only wanted him to clean the bottom floor (so it hired him for 4 hours), he cleaned it so quickly so there is time to work on the upstairs but he is angry that there are more bedrooms and bathrooms than listed, even tho ive told him he doesnt have to finish it all, only the time i hired him for.\n\nSo, I used an app to pay for a cleaner to come today, Its something me and my siblings do when we use our parents house when they travel (we are between the ages of 17 - 22 so we can pull together enough money for it) and when they are away, we have more freinds over than usual, might have a house party. They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can. But hiring a proffesional with their tools and solutions really helps.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or it would've \n have hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getting annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hired him for and then leave. Even if its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.", "I'm 25F, and live across the country from my family. I'm wrapping up a weeklong visit home now, and up until this point it had been really nice.\n\nOn Monday, I had a free morning and wanted to be helpful, so I did some laundry. As I was putting a load into the washing machine, my younger sister came in with some clothes she said she wanted cleaned ASAP. I had no problem with that so I took them to add to the current load.\n\nWhile hanging everything up, I noticed that there was a battered Juul in the bottom of the washer. I pulled it out and brought it to my sister, figuring it was hers. As soon as I told her that it had gone through a wash cycle, she got really annoyed and asked if I'd gone through the pockets before I washed her stuff. I admitted I hadn't.\n\nAfter that, she was even more annoyed & upset. She said since I ruined the Juul, it was on me to buy her a whole new one and a pack of new pods. Here's where I'm not sure if my position is right or not:\n\nI said no, absolutely not. That not only was it on her to keep track of her possessions, but that it was illegal for her to even own one and that I wouldn't do something technically illegal to replace it for her.\n\nAt this point, she was crying and yelling really loudly, so our mom came in to ask what was up. We each related what had happened. Then, mom turned to me and told me that if it was going to cause issues between us, I needed to be the bigger person and replace the Juul. That a sisterly relationship is more important than a silly little toy. I told her what a Juul actually is and the legalities involved, but she cut me off to say that that didn't make a difference and it was the principle of the matter that dictated I should replace it. I said, well, what if I take her shopping and spend the equivalent amount? My sister cut in and said \"I don't want anything you're only spending $50 on\", and I said something snarky about definitely not buying her a Juul in that case cause that's what they cost. \n\nBy then, my mom had about had it, and told me that it's on me to make this right. That I can choose to be a goody two-shoes and damage my relationship with my sister, or suck it up and fix this. I've refused, and as a result this vacation has become incredibly tense. My sister won't speak to me more than a word or two, and my mom is mysteriously super busy when we were supposed to have plans (she already took off work for them, so I know she's just being petty about this). My flight is on Saturday, so I have another couple days of this to endure if I'm gonna stand my ground.\n\nAm I really the asshole here?", "Mate and I (both 26 & 27M) flew from Madrid to Frankfurt for the wedding of our friend who lives there now and used seat selection to pick an aisle for him and a window for me in the same row hoping it would be empty and no one sat there.\n\nA woman also in her 20s came and realised she was in the middle seat and that my mate and I knew each other. She asked if she could not in the middle of us.\n\nWe said \"should have seat selected then, no\".\n\nShe explained that this is her connecting flight via codeshare and she could only seat select on the main legs of her flight with the airline operating them, but not this ticket. (Frankfurt to Singapore and then Singapore to somewhere in Australia).\n\nWe told her \"too bad\".\n\nWe didn't want to move seats. We were disappointed someone was put in the middle but I wanted the window, mate wanted the aisle.\n\nInstead of accepting this, she started typing something on her phone and flagged down a flight attendant and passed them the phone. I guess she complained in that way instead of having the guts to do it so we could hear.\n\nFlight attendant then said we had to move so she was not sitting in the middle.\n\nMy mate is claustrophobic and really likes the aisle, I didn't want to move from window either because I like looking out during landing. They doubled down and said one of us has to move so I said \"fine, bitch can have the window\". She objected to the window because \"being between two large men who are strangers and a wall was \"triggering and uncomfortable\".\n\nI rolled my eyes and she said \"i have been both assaultd and groped by men before, I'm not comfortable about it and this is triggering my anxiety\".\n\nA guy sitting across from us called us both assholes, gave her his seat on the aisle and the flight attendants made my made go in the middle and let that guy have the aisle. He also blocked us getting up and off the plane until she was gone and off, and we were given a ton of dirty looks.\n\nThe flight attendants were really rude when we spoke to them at the end of the flight. They seemed to have decided that we are douchebags and ignored our complaints.\n\nWere we the douches? She wasn't going to get attacked on a plane, and I'm honestly sick of women crying \"me too\" and \"anxiety\" to get out of things. You drew the middle seat short straw, suck it up princess.", "So this is a currently unfolding situation.\n\nBackground: My entire family is poor and lives paycheck to paycheck. I earned a scholarship to college and then started a career so I am the only member of our family that is not living in poverty. My husband and I are solidly middle class. For the past decade or so, we have been hosting family get-togethers about once a month, inviting my whole family (3 siblings and spouses plus my parents) and paying for everything (food, drink, etc).\n\nCurrent situation: My husband was laid off about a year ago and has been unemployed or underemployed ever since. He is currently working at about 50% of his old salary. Things are financially difficult. We are just covering our bills with our combined income and if anything extra comes up, we have to take it out of savings. One area that we are trying to save money with is hosting these family get-together. We haven\u2019t stopped completely (we hosted Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, Mother\u2019s Day, and some birthdays) but we have stopped hosting lesser holidays (skipped Super Bowl Sunday and Memorial Day). Today is Independence Day. We normally have a get together but we told everyone we would just be spending a quiet holiday alone with our children.\n\nYesterday, my mom called upset that we weren\u2019t hosting anything. I told her we were just going to spend the day swimming (we belong to a swim club). Immediately she got excited and wanted to come, along with my youngest sister who lives at home. I eventually agreed but said it would only be for a few hours. Later in the day, all of my siblings started calling me and asking when they could come over to use the pool and what were we doing for dinner. Now, I have to pay to get them into the swim club and I have no interest in paying for them all to eat and drink all day long. So after talking it over with my husband, we decided to call them all and tell them that we could not host a meal, but if they each wanted to bring a dish to share and anything they wanted to drink, we would host a potluck meal so we could all eat together. Well they didn\u2019t like that well. One said that they don\u2019t get paid until Friday and had no food in the house so it was like us telling them that they couldn\u2019t come. One said that it wasn\u2019t fair. They want to see the family. Making them bring food takes money they would use to buy groceries and is like taking food out of their family\u2019s mouth.\n\nWe didn\u2019t give in. I wasn\u2019t planning to host. If they want to come, then they can contribute. But from their perspective, I have money that they don\u2019t and it\u2019s selfish to ask them to bring anything. So Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: Responded to a comment and thought it was worth sharing here so you could all understand why they think ITA.\n\nYes, technically I could pull money from savings to pay for this. They have never had savings so having money in the bank feels like wealth to them. But the way I worked my way out of poverty is to not spend more than I make each month and build up an emergency fund.  I am using that emergency fund to get through this difficult financial time. I have no idea how much longer my husband will be under employed and I want to make my savings last as long as possible. So I\u2019m just not willing to spend my savings on extravagances. But to them, I have money I could use and am choosing not to while they don\u2019t have much money at all so ITA for asking them to contribute. Which is why my original plan was just to each do our own thing for the holiday rather than getting together and creating this issue.\n\nUpdate: So it worked out okay. Not everyone came. I did end up paying for those who did at the swim club. But one sibling and his family brought a lot of food (meats, bread, side, and condiments) which basically doubled what we had to offer. They were kind about it. They had some food in their freezer they brought and had picked up a little bit more on their way over. Another family member brought a small side, some soda, and a dessert. There was enough to eat for everyone and we split up all the leftovers so everyone had some food to take home. It ended up being a nice day.", "My husband got home while I was making dinner.  Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\nEdit*. I walked away for a while because you know... kids.  And I am blown away by the amount of comments.  Yes,  I realize to a point that this isn\u2019t normal behavior.  This is fairly new for my husband (the last year and a half or so).  He has sort of been diagnosed with OCD and this has been my life for a while with it.  Sometimes I lack perspective.  When she was a newborn he was changing her diaper and she explosively pooped (like across the room all over him type pooping) and he laughed about it.  That was before.  So I know a lot of people have certain ideas about him, but this isn\u2019t the man I married.  He used to be really helpful with these things, but now I change easily 98% of diapers.  I was really, really pissed this morning which led me to writing this.  But seriously having all of you comment put things into a better perspective.  \n\nI told him in no uncertain terms that he needs individual counseling and we need marriage counseling (I am already in counseling myself).\n\nEdit 2-  I wanted to add because some one was wondering if I left anything else out... and I thought I could add context.  We also have a dog who is 18 months and I am still working on house breaking.  She has an accident inside maybe once a week (it\u2019s also very cold out and she is tiny so those don\u2019t mix well).  Part of his pee issues have come from that.  He thinks the dog is my responsibility and I know a lot of his pent up anger comes from that.  I don\u2019t know if that is relevant to this situation as I don\u2019t think they are related.  He thought he found pee on the carpet earlier in the day (he was mad at me because I wouldn\u2019t smell it to make sure and I told him I\u2019d clean it up when I got a second - I knew it was not pee as one of the kids had walked through with wet shoes).", "My girlfriend, D, and I have been together for three months. I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what's up\" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what's up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.", "My son is at a high school where drinking and drugs are rampant. \n\nHe\u2019s a great kid. He studies hard and he has a job and he always tells me or his mom where he\u2019s going to be when he leaves the house. \n\nA couple weeks ago he came to me and said he was curious about drinking, that he knows it isn\u2019t good for him and we\u2019d be really disappointed if he went out and drank, but he wants to know what he\u2019s missing. \n\nI explained about people feeling alcohol relaxes them in social situations, self medicating, how a lot of his friends just drink to look cool to other people and wouldn\u2019t actually be doing it if they didn\u2019t feel they had to, etc. \n\nBut when I started thinking these same thoughts around his age, it was the beginning of my going out and experimenting behind my parents backs. \n\nSo I told him there was nothing mystical or special about alcohol and to prove to him he wasn\u2019t missing some once in a lifetime teenage experience, I\u2019d get us some beers and we could drink them together at home. I just asked he promise me he wouldn\u2019t go out and drink at house parties because he\u2019d be putting himself in unsafe situations and jeopardizing his health. \n\nHe had a can and a half before he was tipsy  (he\u2019s 120-125 pounds soaking wet) and barely even got that far because he hated the taste. \n\nHe said thanks for the experience, it sucked, he wouldn\u2019t be taking up drinking. \n\nObviously I said if he had any other questions or if anything ever happened he could always come to me. And that was that. \n\nMy wife is ENRAGED. I didn\u2019t think to run this by her (yes, that part was a mistake) because usually we\u2019re on the same page about child raising decisions and put up a united front. She\u2019s convinced it\u2019s done some sort of irrepressible damage to his brain to get drunk that one time. My argument is better once under our supervision than who knows how often at strangers houses. \n\nShe says showing demystifying alcohol and making it seem like less of a big deal will make him more likely to drink, not less. I disagree.\n\nThis is our first teenager and my parents never talked to me about drugs and alcohol growing up so I have no template. AITA?", "I'm a teacher so I get about 2 months off every summer but my mom, sister, aunt, and cousin all work regular 9-5 jobs with 2-3 weeks off a year, so it's really difficult to organize time for trips where we can all go. We managed to schedule a girls trip to Cabo from June 1st to 9th. Made payments (almost $3K a person) several weeks prior to the trip and were all very excited to go to Mexico and bond -- I'm best friends with my sister & cousin, and my mom and aunt are identical twins so we're all a very close group.\n\nMy boyfriend & I have been together for 2 years. His family lives across the country so I only see them twice a year and it's usually pretty quick. No real one-on-one bonding with anyone in his family but we're all definitely friendly with one another. We like each other's posts on FB/IG, send happy birthday wishes, stuff like that. \n\nA few days before we left, my boyfriend's mom passed away unexpectedly. I spent days attached to his hip, supporting him, wrote the email to his work explaining what happened, cleaning the apartment, making sure he ate, called his dad & siblings and expressed my condolences, booked his flight, helped him pack, etc. He asked me to go to the funeral with him. I felt so, so, so bad telling him no. I hardly knew his mom and feel like I already committed myself to the trip with my family. He was heartbroken and begged me to go with him for support but I told him that his whole family is there and if anything it's a special time for them all to recount memories of their mother/wife/sister/daughter. \n\nHe asked if he gave me $1500 \"could you go on the trip sometime later? you have two more months off. I know you won't get some deposits back, so I'll give you this money\" and I honestly felt so bad but the thing isn't the money (although obviously as a teacher, I'm not swimming in money) but it's about how this is the *one* time a year that the women I'm closest to can go together.\n\nMy mom & aunt told me \"we want you to come with us, but it's ultimately up to you\" whereas my cousin & sister were like \"you should definitely come with us, it'll ruin the trip for us if you're not there, just come, etc.\"\n\nMy boyfriend was upset and left mad at me, I called/texted a bunch but he didn't respond until days later, anyways I went to Mexico and came back on the 9th and things have been weird with us. Sometimes he's really close with me like usual other times I can tell he's mad I didn't go with him. He said he's not furious at me but just disappointed and sad that I chose to go party instead of be there with him. Says he would've dropped anything for me, keeps emphasizing that I have 2 months of vacation, but he doesn't get that no one else in the group has that kind of vacation time, I really couldn't reschedule.\n\n\nTL;DR: I feel really bad because I didn't go with my boyfriend to his mom's funeral because I already had a trip planned with my family. Did I fuck up?", "My fianc\u00e9 and I are a few months into planning our wedding and we are now deciding on who we are inviting. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 comes from a super conservative and religious background but has thankfully grown way form that (otherwise I couldn't marry her!)\n\nHer parents however are still super conservative and homophobic and delight in talking shit and all sorts of horrible tings about the LGBT community. Other members of her family are like this as well, some more violently vocal than others. \n\nWell, for our wedding we have decided that everyone we invite can bring a plus one (subject to our approval of course). \n\nI thought about it for a really long time about my older brother and his husband (they've been married 3 years) and I don't want his husband to attend with him. \n\nThe drama if they attend together has the potential to get out of hand and that is something I don't want to have to deal with on my wedding day. My fianc\u00e9 also agrees with me on this. \n\nWe can't not invite her parents and we can't not invite my brother so we felt our only option was to not invite his husband.\n\nWho knows what could be said or done if he attends and yeah, we're being selfish but it's our wedding. \n\nI'm really not sure how he'll react though. It took my brother a long time to accept himself and  I'm sure this won't feel good but at the same time maybe his husband won't want to attend anyways.\n\nI have nothing against my brother's husband. He is a lovely man but we are just trying to have the day go smoothly. \n\nWhen we extend the invitations out I think I'm going to go to my brother in person and ask him not to bring his husband for all the reasons above.\n\nSo WIBTA if I asked him not to bring his husband?", "My older brother is on the autism spectrum. He\u2019s functioning to where he can have a job (janitor), hang out with friends, etc. but he cannot live alone for several reasons. Growing up, my parents always told me that I would be the one to take care of him when the time came and that he would have to live with me. I was never expected to help much when we were kids when it came to the disorder, but it was just what they wanted me to do when both of them passed on. My mom has never wanted him living in a \u201chome\u201d.\n\nAs I got older, I started bringing up the idea of assisted living to her and she got upset. She says no one will take care of him in the same way she does. I sort of just let it go, because I know it\u2019s a sensitive issue. My dad, I know, was either way about it but tended to side with my mom and say that \u201cfamily takes care of family\u201d.\n\nMy father passed away a few years back, not long after I married my wife. My mother isn\u2019t sick at the moment, but the time will come at some point where I will be responsible (and it\u2019s in the will that when she dies, I am the person responsible for my brother since he cannot make choices for himself).\n\nI admitted to my wife that I don\u2019t want my brother living with us. I love my brother, don\u2019t get me wrong. I just do not want to be responsible for him and I think he will thrive living in an assisted living facility. He already attends activities at one and he loves it. My wife has basically said, it\u2019s up to me because he\u2019s my brother. I\u2019ve spoken to him about it and he says that he doesn\u2019t care where he lives, so long as he can keep his routine. I promised him that we\u2019d (my wife, the kids and myself) visit him and he could come to us, he could still keep his job (which is the most important thing to him), he could do even more activities there, etc.\n\nMy mom is upset with me that this is what I want to do. I told her that ultimately, it will be my choice as his guardian, unless she wanted to change that. We have other family, but no one else that would take him on full time. She said that this was the last thing she ever wanted, but I pointed out that she never asked me what I did either.\n\nAITA here?", "My college roommate (we'll call him Steve) has type 1 diabetes.\n\nLast week, we had the opportunity to purchase a used mini-fridge for our room at a dorm sale. I asked if he would be down to pitch in for one we could share, and he politely declined. I still wanted access to my own fridge in the room, so I ordered a personal 12-can refrigerator.\n\nWhen it arrived, Steve asked if he could store his insulin inside the fridge. Wanting to be a good roommate, I obliged. Little did I know, his insulin would take up 25% of the space in my tiny desktop refrigerator that I paid for! He did not want a bigger mini-fridge when we had the chance to purchase one, but now that I have my own, he wants to use it.\n\nWIBTA if I ask him to remove his insulin? Keep in mind, there is a full-sized refrigerator in the basement that everyone has access to, and I assume thats where he stored his insulin previously.\n\nEDIT: The mini-fridge we had the option to purchase would have had a 75 liter capacity. My personal fridge has a mere 10 liter capacity.", "To preface, I don't have any service. I went to Navy boot camp for 2 weeks, then got separated for suicidal ideation and was sent home.\n\nWith today being veterans day, a couple people said it to me (maybe slightly jokingly?) And I've had a few others thank me in the past. Every time it happens, I feel shitty for it. I'm always like \"but I don't have any. I'm not a veteran, I screwed up.\"\n\nToday I ordered an ice cream at work, and my coworker gave me it for free, which I assume was for the veterans day promotional thing we're doing (1 free ice cream for veterans). I did try to hand him my card, but he just said \"okay\" and walked away.\n\nFor the next 10 minutes or so I sat in my car crying because of getting a free ice cream I didn't earn, while eating said ice cream.\n\nI know you might be thinking this is a joke, because of how dumb it sounds, but I do really feel conflicted. Like I'm getting some sort of stolen valor or something.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people saying that it's okay because I tried my best, and it was out of my control. I want to clarify that it was my fault for going home, they did suggeat pretty strongly that I separate, but they left the decision ultimately up to me whether or not to go home or stay in.\n\nEdit 2: \"Why does everyone at your job know that you went to boot camp?\"\nA few reasons, \n\n1) I was told that I have to disclose it in my interview (for tax reasons or something, I don't remember exactly why).\n\n2) There's not too many other interesting things to know about me.\n\n3) I worked with an Army veteran, and it was something non-work related that we could relate on.\n\n4) It's a small place, everyone hears about everything.\n\n5) It gets mentioned in conversation for one reason or another. Like \"why'd you start working here?\"", "Skip to last paragraph for quick summary.\n\nI grew up with these guys. Our friend group was roughly 10. We knew each other since 6th grade, hung out every lunch period, tried to ensure we were in the same classes at HS, and hung out every weekend, sleepovers, etc.  After graduating, 8 of us even went to the same university, lived in the same apartment complex, same floor, and even roomed together every year. Our relationship did change a bit at University. They got into frats, drinking, smoking weed, while I did not. So at parties, I did have to go through an adjustment period of them getting drunk, rowdy, or simply smelling weed in the air. Regardless, I got used to it and I thought everything was great again as we'd hang out often.\n\nWe all graduated and went our separate ways. Different states, careers, post grad, etc. First few years, we'd hangout again when we'd all visit home and we would visit each other's places if we had free time and money. Around year 3, I noticed not as much communication towards me, and noticed on social media that some of them would get together every few months to hangout. The communication got less until it was non-existent outside of 2 of them for the next few years.\n\n4 years post grad, I'm getting married. Send out invitations to all my friends and while some had legitimate excuses, most people just said \"I can't make it\", with only the 2 mentioned before showing up. At this point, the signs are obvious and I know they just don't care about talking with me, it hurts, and I decide to move on. After getting married, the wife and I located to the same city where one of my friends who had a legitimate excuse lives. I text 3 times in a span of 3 weeks and no response. So I know where he stands.\n\n3 years later my career has exploded to the point I was mentioned in a magazine pertaining to our industry. I'm not making millions or anything, but it's a possibility as my work has reached a lot of ears. One of my friends I still keep in touch with shared it on social media, and now I am getting text messages from those friends who stopped talking to me.\n\nI know it's not worth my time to rekindle our friendships, but I did respond, but have also kept my distance. Now, I'm getting invited to hangout with them, or asking if I'm \"free\" if they happen to visit my city, or if I will be visiting \"home\" during the holidays. Part of me is tempted to ghost them right back. Another part is to professionally let them know how they hurt me by ghosting me originally without any explanation. And then there is that part that is really tempted to just lay it out on them. WIBA if I go the third route?  \n\n\nEdit: I've had a chance to go through all these responses late last night, early this morning and I plan to go through the rest during lunch. There's a lot of variety in responses, but the things that stood out to me the most is that lashing out at them may result in my career being hurt down the road. I also consulted my two friends I still keep in touch with (they also keep in touch with the other guys), and also suggested something similar along with just taking things slow with them. Given I had already responded a few times to some of the messages, I'm just going to keep things at arm's length and go with a \"I'm busy\" route with the current invites I've gotten. From there, things will just stop, but if they persist, I will re-evaluate what to do next (though not lash out).\n\nThanks everyone.", "I know this will sound almost made up but I swear on my mothers grave this isn't a karma farm or troll job. For part one we have been inundated with scorpions this year. We think it's the wet winter just caused an explosion of them. We have had them inside, outside, in the drains, clothes...everywhere. We have an exterminator but it takes time. So far no stings, thank god.\n\nPart two is my husband wears a CPAP mask. It works and when he puts it on he goes into super sleep mode and is dead do the world.\n\nHe had it on last night and I read reading and out of the corner of the eye I just noticed a little black movement indside the hose that connects the humidifier to the mask. I really didn't think much of it but figured I'd get our black light just in case. In the time it took me to turn out the overhead light and find the black light flashlight the scorpion had moved up the hose much closer to his face. The black light verified that it was a scorpion. I panicked and ran out of the room. \n\nHusband must have sense my movement and screams because he woke up and took his mask off to ask me what's wrong. I didn't see it but I guess when he did that the scorpion fell into his lap. He screamed at me that there was a scorpion in the bed and to bring him the black light. I said no the scorpion is in your mask! Well that caused him to freak out even more but we were able to find the scorpion and kill it.\n\nHe is so furious with me for not \"helping him\" when I saw the scorpion was close to his face. Like so furious he isn't speaking to me and texted me that he doesn't want to be around me for date night tonight. I feel bad but I packicked and I don't know what I should have done anyways. Was I the asshole for how I reacted last night?\n\nEdit: about 4pm, I guess date night is back on so I\u2019m at least partially forgiven.\n\nEdit 2: date night went good, I apoligized profusely. He said he could laugh about it now and all is well. I guess I'm not getting divorced (much to the chagrin of the meaner posters) time for some makeup DS and maybe since I owe him, CIM. Hopefully no scorpions in the sheets.", "In 2017 I moved in with 2 roommates from Craigslist in their mid-20\u2019s, Heather & Jeff. I lived with them for a little under a year. Heather was on the shyer, more reserved side and not easy to talk to, but we got along well. I moved out just over a year ago about 20 miles away, and hadn\u2019t seen her since, though we\u2019re still friends on Facebook.\n\nRecently, I joined a new gym, & my second time there I was surprised to see someone who instantly recognized as Heather behind the front desk! This was surprising as she lives 20 miles away; but I was absolutely certain it was her. I said, \u201cHey Heather! Good to see you again.\u201d She gave me a really funny stare and told me she\u2019s not Heather.\n\nHer voice sounded just like Heather\u2019s as well. She told me her name is Maddie, and it was clear she didn\u2019t recognize me. I walked away feeling super embarrassed and puzzled. That girl looked, sounded and acted **so** identical to Heather in every way, shape and form; to a degree that is impossible to be a simple coincidence.\n\nI pondered things in my mind, and on my way out approached Maddie. I asked her, \u201cSorry if this is too personal, but I\u2019m wondering - are you adopted by any chance?\u201d She responded that she is, but hasn\u2019t made any effort to find her bio family. I told her that I strongly suspect that I know her identical twin sister, and explained things to her.\u00a0\n\nI showed a picture of Heather on my phone to her, and to my surprise she didn\u2019t act all that impressed, just giving me a simple, \u201cHmmmm. Okay.\u201d I told her that I have Heather\u2019s #, am friends with her on Facebook, have her address and would be happy to connect them, and she responded disinterestedly, \u201cNo thanks.\u201d\n\nI called Heather later & explained things to her, and **she too** seemed disinterested. I found Maddie\u2019s profile on Facebook (by searching \u201cpeople who work at \\[name of my gym\\]\u201d) and texted Heather photos of her. But still, she acted disinterested. I\u2019ve met Heather\u2019s parents & they strongly resemble her, so what I suspect is that Heather\u2019s mom had an extra baby (Maddie) that she gave up for adoption and never told her about.\n\nI continued going to the gym, and almost every time I went Maddie would be there. Every time I saw Heather\u2019s exact double, it would continue to bug me. I feel like I discovered something really amazing and groundbreaking, and it\u2019s going unappreciated.\n\nI added Maddie on Facebook and she accepted. Maybe she didn\u2019t know it was me, since I have the mascot for a beloved baseball team of mine instead of a picture of myself as my profile picture. Having both girls as friends, I messaged both of them into a three-way Facebook chat, finally forcing them to interact with one another.\n\nI was promptly blocked by both of them, and don\u2019t know how things turned out. I\u2019m now pretty nervous to go to the gym, and am considering looking for a new one. Was I the asshole to try and reunite these girls who I\u2019m positive are twins?", "**EDIT**\nHaha I know guys, I'm dumb for not catching on. But it's a hella busy work environment, line was out the door, every conversation is 90% the same and my transaction time needs to be like 2 minutes to do everything.

This means my till will pop up with a returning customers information so they can get in faster. \nSo basically, a couple came in today (on a very busy day) and wanted to sign up for the free membership. As I was putting in their details, my till notified me that the guy already had a membership pass. \n\nI said \"Oh hey, looks like you've already got a membership!\" \n\nBut he looked alarmed and muttered \"No I don't.\" I brought up the information and saw he had last come in June, so I informed him of this. \n\n\"Have you been here before?\" His girlfriend asked him. He shook his head no. Thing is, we keep photos of everyone for their pass and it was definitely this guy. I thought he'd just forgotten, so I insisted; \n\n\"Yeah, you're right here! This is your photo! Your name is 'Gary' right?\"\n\nHe looked me dead in the eye and shook his head. I thought he'd just forgotten, people forget all the time so I really thought I was being helpful, so decided to look at the whole previous transaction and noticed he'd been there with someone else. \n\n\"Yeah says here, you came in with an 'Alesha'?\" I told him. His girlfriend slammed her hand down on my desk and snapped at him; \n\n\"You were here with 'ALESHA'?!\" \n\nShe was pissed off. Went through the rest of the transaction in a very awkward atmosphere, and they hurried off. I saw the girlfriend leave alone a half hour later, clearly flustered and upset. 'Gary' left about an hour later, and glared at me as he left. \n\nMy boss found it absolutely hilarious that I didn't get the hint that 'Gary' was probably trying to cover up that he'd been there with 'Alesha', and I probably should've helped the guy out. I don't know how I feel about it now, but I do feel quite bad that I failed to pick up on the hints; he wasn't just a forgetful customer on a busy day, he was trying to cover up something that probably destroyed his relationship today. \n\nTLDR; I accidentally outed a cheater at work, probably breaking up a relationship.\n\n****\n*EDIT 2* \n\nWow I did not expect this to blow up so much! Thanks so much for making me feel better guys :\") Just wanted to pop in some extra info;\n\n-I don't feel like an asshole for not helping him cheat, more that I got ravelled up in something that's not my business, even though I was just doing my job\n\n-I'm not a guy\n\n-The place I work at does not break any laws, everything collected is with consent. I have broken no rules or laws by seeing that this guy has a group membership pass with another woman, it's just on the system that he signed up for. Also this isn't something I'd get sued over, that's not really a thing over here.\n\n-I'm not slow or stupid, I just have a very no-crap attitude at work. Especially on busy days. \n\nI'm just happy that so many of you are finding this as funny as my boss did!! \ud83d\ude02", "  \n\nThe title sounds extreme but here are the details. My wife and I have been together for 5 years. I love her so much that it pains me to write this. The thing is, I was the sole earner for a while and I was happy to provide (I am a software developer at a local startup that has tripled in employees and gone exponential in revenue). We're not having kids, so my wife got bored of being home and doing nothing. So she got a job at a law firm as a paralegal. \n\nEnter this attorney, who I'll call Brandon. My wife started to bring him up quite a bit. You know when your wife starts talking about something, drops it, and then brings it up again a few minutes or hours later like there was no gap? My wife does that with stories about him. I searched through her Facebook friends list one day for \"Brandon\" and saw that they had connected. Okay... Then my wife starts going to work happy hours and I'm seeing pictures of the guy on her timeline. In most of the pictures she is positioned next to him, holding a drink. Okay...\n\nI have gained considerable weight since joining the startup. There is free food provided to us nearly every day. My wife has maintained a really low weight and looks as beautiful as she did at 22. Brandon is more like how I used to be weight wise. However, I believe I make more money than he does.\n\nSo here it goes... I take off work on Friday, as my team is nearing the end of our project. I wait for my wife to leave the firm and I see her walking out with Brandon. They get in my wife's car, purchased on my dime, and I follow them for a bit. They go to a local dive bar and it turns out all of her coworkers are there - I see them entering. I wait for hours and everyone eventually leaves. My wife leaves last with Brandon and she takes him home. I don't see any physical contact as he exits the vehicle to go inside his apartment building.\n\nAt this point, I'm sick. I'm gutted. I wait at home for my wife and confront her about Brandon. She went insane basically, threatening to end the marriage because I stalked her. She told me she is always the DD for happy hour because she doesn't drink much (which is true), but she didn't address my greater concerns. AITA?\n\n \n\nTL;DR Followed my wife one evening because of her weird relationship with an attorney at the firm she joined", "EDIT: Hello friends! I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your judgements, they\u2019ve cleared some things up and I\u2019m seriously reevaluating my family relationships. ALSO thank you so so so much for the birthday wishes! They mean so much to me! <3\n\nI\u2019m turning 18 on April 1st, but I\u2019m having my party on March 30th. I planned my birthday party three weeks ago, so lots of people had time to work their schedules around it. I planned a nice dinner and invited my entire family and everyone said they would come. Then suddenly, a week before my birthday, my aunt and my uncle planned their kid\u2019s party on the exact same day as mine, despite their kid\u2019s birthday being on the 23rd of March. All my but 3 of my family members have cancelled coming to my party to go to my little cousin\u2019s. Everyone is saying I should just go to my cousin\u2019s party and basically share a birthday party with her. \n\nNo offence to this baby, but I wasn\u2019t really wanting to share my 18th with a 1 year old. Yesterday my mom messaged the family group chat saying that she was upset for everyone assuming I should share a birthday party with my cousin. My aunt\u2019s family told my mom and I that we\u2019re being \u201cignorant and childish\u201d. They also told me to go cry somewhere else. I then defended my mom and myself by saying that I was only upset that everyone cancelled on me, and that I\u2019d still come to their party. I also told them not to insult my mom for defending me. I then left the group chat because I didn\u2019t want to fight with my uncle. My aunt and my uncle think I\u2019m trying to ruin their little girl\u2019s special day. My aunt\u2019s say I should just go to my cousin\u2019s party and they\u2019d all see me there. My mom and my grandma all said I have a right to be upset. I\u2019m pissed because I planned all this and now a lot of people aren\u2019t coming. So I gotta know, am I being unreasonable here? Am I an asshole?

I don\u2019t go around making fun of your alligator arm\u201d \n\nA couple people laughed but jerry lost it started screaming at me. My boss told to never to that again and a couple coworkers refuse to talk to me.", " My husband and I began looking at getting away from the city a few years ago. We had a small checklist: husband wanted permanent running water, I wanted a house. We looked at many properties before we stumbled across this one by a fluke. It has two permanent creeks and a small house and is absolutely perfect. The property runs adjacent to a national park so it will always remain secluded. We both instantly fell in love and even though it was quite out of our budget, our parents both loved it as well and helped us purchase it. The property itself is almost 100 acres and is the very last house on the dirt road. (Also, I should mention that the seller of the property was an elderly man who only used this place as a weekender and owned his permanent home in the city)\n\nOne of the main things that drew us to this place is the permanent creeks. They are full of swimming holes and one of the best ones even had a rope tied to the tree. Real estate agents said that a few local kids had used it because previous owner was never there and didn\u2019t mind. \n\nThe road turns into an easement to get to the national park entrance and the creek line is the boundary of our property to the national park. The swimming hole in question is about midway between the easement and our house. Over the years, this swimming hole has become well known to the locals and there is a path that has been made to get to this swimming hole that is on our property.  \n\nWe certainly didn\u2019t like the idea of strangers walking so near the house so Husband puts up a wire fence across the path and a no trespassing sign. Within days of putting it up, a woman walks around the fence and to our house to yell at us saying that she has been walking this path and swimming for 30 years. We politely tell her that it is private property and just because the old owners didn\u2019t mind doesn\u2019t mean we do as well. Less than a week after this incident, somebody posts about the fence in our local suburb Facebook group and while many people were angry, many understood as well. We\u2019re not asking people to not swim. We don\u2019t own the water, we\u2019re just asking people to go to the national park side to access the swimming hole (because we DO own right up to the waters edge). However, about another week later, our sign is stolen and the wire fence is cut. We have made it very clear what our reasoning is. We purchased this property for privacy and so far, people are more invasive than if we had purchased in the city. Just today, I was out mowing (we haven\u2019t replaced the sign or fence yet) and 3 girls come walking from this path and walk directly across the front paddock, essentially our front yard. Am I the A-hole for wanting to protect my privacy? \n\nTldr; The access to a really awesome swimming hole, that has been used for generations, is on our property and we don\u2019t want people trespassing to get to it.\n\nEdit: I tried to sketch the layout. Sorry it\u2019s not great \n[bad sketch](https://imgur.com/gallery/x1vaKkL) \n\nDidn\u2019t really want to say this but I am 26F and my husband works away for 2 weeks at a time. And there is no phone reception at all. Safety is a valid concern. We haven\u2019t sought any legal advice and I doubt we will. We\u2019ll try a few more peaceful resolves (signs, clearing a new path on the other side and planting plants on our on path) and if nothing works then that\u2019s it. They win. It\u2019s not a war I\u2019m willing to wage because I do actually want to continue living here.", "My friend and her new husband came to visit my wife and I last week, so we could finally meet him. We couldn\u2019t attend the wedding because of work, it was too far for us and it was just not doable. Anyway, they arrive, guy shows zero interest and enthusiasm of being here, but whatever, everybody has those days. We wanted to go  to a new restaurant close to our place, and he is complaining that it \u2018s too hot to walk outside, that we should order instead. Cool, let\u2019s stay home and order. We are eating, having a few beers, talking to my friend mostly, cause the dude is not having it. I tried to engage so many times, but I just got short answers for everything. Now I\u2019m starting to get annoyed, cause this guy is making things really unpleasant for everyone. He got super upset that his ice cream order was screwed up and he got something different, it was like watching a 5 year old kid. Still, we\u2019re trying to deal with this fucking  idiot. Then he started looking at the pictures in our fridge, and then he turned to my wife and said\u201d wow I almost didn\u2019t recognize you in this picture, you look so good\u201d. Backstory, my wife gained some pounds over the years, maybe 15,20 pounds, it\u2019s not much ,but she hates it, makes her super sad and self conscious. So when this fucker said that, I just lost it and said \u201c alright man, you\u2019re done, get the fuck out\u201d. My wife was paralyzed and so was our friend, and then I continued \u201c I\u2019m sorry but he\u2019s been an asshole since he got here, this is my house, and you dont come in here and talk shit about my wife, so yeah, get the fuck out\u201d. The idiot couldn\u2019t believe what was happening, then my friend started crying, grabbed her purse and they left. He didn\u2019t say a word. My wife also started crying as soon as they left and said that she couldn\u2019t believe what I just did, that I ruined her friendship, to which I replied saying that I was just defending her against that asshole. She said that I overreacted and just because he was an asshole I didnt have to be one also. So then we argued the rest of the night and eventually decide to stop talking about it cause we would never agree on the matter. My wife tried calling our friend and sending messages but so far no reply. Am I the asshole here?", "I drive a 1988 Trans Am and I was going to get my oil changed one day since it had been about five or six months since I got my last one. I pull in to the mechanic\u2019s shop I go to since I know him pretty good and he gives me a good deal. We\u2019re just a couple good ol boys. I pull up and one of the guys working up there, Bruce, tells me that there\u2019s a two hour wait since they\u2019re really busy. Now normally, I\u2019m not one to fuss, but me and the shop owner Jeremy have a gentleman\u2019s agreement where I\u2019ve been going to him and his shop for about 25 years now, he\u2019ll usually put me ahead of the line and save me some time. But two hours was too long for me today since I had a few appointments coming up and I told the first guy Bruce as much. I guess Bruce doesn\u2019t know or doesn\u2019t care about the arrangement me and Jeremy has and tells me if I want it done any faster I would have to change it myself. \n\n\n\nNow I\u2019m no dummy and I know my way around the car I\u2019ve had for 30 years. So I make a run over to the auto parts store and pick up a few quarts of oil and a filter. I return to the parking lot of Jeremy\u2019s shop and begin doing exactly what Bruce suggested I do, and I change my oil right there in the parking lot. It ends up making a much larger mess than I figured it would, but I\u2019m able to clean up most of it before I go on my way. Jeremy calls me later and asks about what happened and I tell him, he thought it was pretty funny but just not to do it again and to try calling ahead when I needed another change so they could schedule better. That Bruce guy still won\u2019t look me in the eye, though. ", " \n\nI got home yesterday at around 6:30 PM and found my roommate, who is a very good friend, had invited over. But there's more, she had brought her 2-3 year old boy who was pretty adorable. Now keep in mind that I am a parent myself of a 3 year old boy and a 5 year old boy, so I'm VERY protective of kids so I might be overthinking things, but I don't think I am.\n\nWhen I got there they had the kid sitting in the family room watching childrens shows, but the tv was muted and she had her music blasting really loud instead. now this music was, in my opinion, music that a 2-3 year old boy shouldn't be listening to for at least 10-13 more years. As an example, when Korns \"yall wanna single\" came on, she goes omg I love this one and turns it up even louder, to the point where we can barely hear each other talk.\n\nNow I want to point out that my friend was pretty drunk at this point so I don't think he even realized anything was going on with the child because I know he wouldn't have been ok with it either, having a 2 year old and a 3 year old himself.\n\nAround 8 PM I went and hid in my room cause she annoyed me, and for the next 2 hours I would say about 90% of the time this little boy was crying, and she either ignored it or would scream at him to shut up. He then went quiet, and about half an hour later I heard them go up to his room. I went out to see what happened to the boy and I saw him curled up in a little ball on the floor next to the couch in just a diaper. The ceiling fan above him was on and he was freezing to the touch, so I put a blanket over him but otherwise didn't want to move him.\n\nI went over and I'm doing the dishes for about 10 minutes when I hear him wake up and start crying. I sat there for about 30 seconds to see if she was going to come down and take care of him, but when she didn't I went over to him and told him everything was gonna be ok and put my arms out to see if he'd let me pick him up, and he basically ran right into my arms. I rocked the little guy to sleep and held him for probably 5-10 minutes because I had a sneaking suspicion that he doesn't get much physical parental cuddles from mommy and all kids need that. I then laid him on the couch and put the blanket back over him.\n\nWIBTA if I called CPS? the reason I haven't yet and the reason I have been going back and forth in my head all day is because...well I've read and heard way too many horror stories about the system, and wonder if he would really be better there. I also know that she got full custody and if she was a BETTER option for that child, the dude must have been a piece of shit. (granted the system doesn't always work in that case, my kids are with my ex wife most of the time and she is almost as bad as this woman was)\n\nneedless to say I wasn't able to sleep much last night. \n\nPlease help, I'm torn.\n\nEdit:  made the call and let them know.  Thank you everyone.  I now have to delete my account because my ex wife found it and I\u2019ve said things here that I really don\u2019t want her to see, she is literally reading through my comments here as I\u2019m typing this.", "Okay this is a bit of a crazy story, So about a month ago I met this cool dude at the gym and we are just gonna call him Tim for now, so I get to know Tim we work out together and all, we go to the bar, the club, everywhere. We are super cool mates. I was looking for one night stands at the time so I'm going about on tinder, when I met this woman (I'm into older women keep in mind) so we chat for a bit, flirt for a couple days, next thing you know we are going out on our first date so I take her to dinner at a nice restaurant, i played for the meals and everything, she got quite tipsy on some wine, but i was still sober. So i pay the bill, take her into my car and she tells me where her place is so I ride over there, she opens the door, and we go into the bedroom, and have sex. So fast foward a couple of days im finishing my workout with my mate Tim. And he invites me over to play some Xbox, so I ride over to his place to the first time, and my heart sank, Its the same house of the woman I had a one night stand with. My legs are shaking and I enter inside, thank god she isn't there. So we sit on the couch and start playing Xbox, when Tim asks me to go pass him a Gatorade from the fridge. So I go up to the fridge and see pictures of him and his family, and it turns out the woman i had sex with was his mother... So I quickly grab a Gatorade for him, and i go back and we play Xbox. I haven't said a word about the situation about me and his mom. Im afraid it will ruin our friendship. Should i Tell him about it? AITA?\n\nEdit: Typos, and many people are saying I \"Raped her\" due to the fact she was tipsy, we we're both on tinder looking for a 1 night stand, and were gonna have sex regardless, i stayed sober so i could drive her.\n\nEdit 2: Damn this made it to the front page, lol cool.", "So I've noticed this annoying and demeaning and rage inducing trend where a public place is packed (Starbucks, library, park, commuter rail), I sit at an empty seat and a lady sitting across says that seat is taken as she is waiting for her friend. Yes, even on a packed train where we're all going home after work, though this one starts off with their purse and bags taking up the seat.\n\nAs you can probably feel from the vibe of my post, I feel this is incredibly selfish and uncalled for behavior. We live in a society (America), hoarding a public good (seats) like this leads to anarchy in the system (people must stand, sit on the ground, walk far away to find an alternative) as there is less for everyone else (2 seats for 1 person). The final straw that broke the camel's back was when I was at the university library, it was packed, the same \"this seat is taken for a friend who is coming\", and fortunately someone else was leaving and I took their spot, only to witness the woman 45 minutes later leave with no one ever arriving.\n\nAfter that whenever I ask if that seat is available and I hear the \"I'm waiting for a friend\" I say \"alright well I'll leave when the friend arrives\", and just sit down. And if the other person arrives, I get up and go. Which I think is a fair compromise. Though at this point it's exhausting trying to change everyone and so I see a girl telling people that open seat is taken and I don't even pick that battle anymore, going somewhere else totally.", "I have a puppy, who is about 6 months old. She lives with me and I live alone, I also don\u2019t have any really young family members/friends with babies so my puppy has not really had any experience around babies. She loves kids but tends to jump up on them (she is a small breed) but I usually discourage kids from trying to pet her only because I know her little nails will scratch them. Otherwise, she loves people and is the friendliest girl. \n\nRecently I was at the dog park to help get her energy out, and we were in the designated Under 25 lbs area. This area is a bit hit or miss because sometimes the dogs in there are old and do nothing but sit in the grass, but the dogs in the regular area were quite big and rowdy that day, so I brought her in to throw her tennis ball and just let her run around. \n\nEnter young mom with 5-6 month old infant in a stroller and her Jack Russell. Cute, I thought. I love dogs and kids, and even said hi to her when she came in. Until she sets a blanket on the ground, takes her kid out of the stroller and lays him on it. Of course none of the other old dogs were bothered, but my pup instantly ran up and was sniffing the baby, trying to lick him, and overall was just being curious. HOWEVER, remember those nails and how they can scratch if she happened to step on an arm or hand or get to close to the face. \n\nI was sitting on a chair across the field so immediately got up, grabbed her, tried to redirect her, and apologized. But she went right back to explore the little human. After many times of redirecting, and asking her to \u201cleave it\u201d (which she is still learning), the mom started to get aggressive with my dog, pushing her away, yelling at her, etc. BUT NOT ONCE did she move her baby, pick him up, or put him back in the stroller. I tried everything I could do before I just picked her up and held her. \n\nI considered leaving but....it\u2019s an off leash DOG park. The park is for dogs to enjoy and exercise in, not for someone to set up a blanket with their baby. She suggested maybe my \u201crowdy\u201d dog should move to the big area, and I said she would be fine if baby was back in the stroller. Of course that was not okay, and she said the dog park was for everyone to enjoy, and I just needed to control my dog. \n\nAITA for thinking she should have just picked up her baby and put him in his stroller? It\u2019s been bothering me :(", "This is more of a \u2018are we the asshole\u2019 I guess. \n\nMy colleagues and I work a very physically demanding job which amongst other things, also involves pools/ life guarding. Because of that we have showers located at work as we are constantly getting sweaty and grimy and need to wash off to attend to other duties/ be presentable. \n\nWhenever we finish \u2018dry reccing\u2019 which is basically us attending to whatever dryside clean ups (not pool related) we are expected to shower. Before you do that you go into the staff room to collect your personal belongings like towels etc. \n\nOur female colleagues started to yell at us at one point when summer got super hot, saying \u2018you smell of unwashed balls, go shower!!\u2019 And other stuff that\u2019s pretty similar. We\u2019d get called gross, some girls actually started to physically push us out the staff room in order to try and get us to not stink up the place. Like yeah, we know we smell, but we are literally going in to grab towels and leave not stand around and have a chat. \n\nThis has become a near daily occurrence and frankly it\u2019s so fucking annoying to walk into the staff room and immediately there\u2019s a group of girls making faces and gagging when you\u2019ve literally just entered. \n\nLast week 3 of the girls had gone to attend to dryside activities which meant that when they came back, they were covered in sweat and grime too. (we work at an Olympic facility and we have to put in a LOT of physical work in the heat so yeah, it\u2019s bad) and so jokingly I said \u2018ew, smells like unwashed pussy, go shower\u2019 \n\nOne of the girls who is the most vocal about us smelling got super super offended and started mouthing off that I was an asshole. A lot of the other guys, some whom I don\u2019t even freaking talk to, joined in and said \u2018yeah, go shower! Don\u2019t you tell us to leave as soon as we get in?\u2019. 2 of em took it well and laughed but the third has been telling everyone and anyone about it all day. \n\nMy boss just shrugged and told her if she could dish it she can take it, so I\u2019m not worried about being in trouble at work, but I just want to know if I\u2019m the asshole.", "A bit of background on myself, I have been separated from my baby mother since just after our son was born, so about 3 years. I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun.

I have granted access to my account to some of my friends from college whom I know are huge GoT fans. Normally I have no problem with them using my account as much as they want to watch whatever they want. \n\nLast week I told the only one of those friends who lives in the same city as me that I was off on sunday night (I'm a bartender and normally work sunday nights) to watch GoT and would she like to get together and watch it. She said no, she had other plans that night but maybe next week. Ok cool.\n\nI just found out through the grapevine that she had a huge GoT watch party at her place and invited all our mutual friends including some of my coworkers (how I found out). She even invited them over next week because she \"has her own HBO account now\", her words according to my coworkers. She's still using my account and I never got an invite, explanation or anything from her, just a \"no, I have other plans\".\n\nWBITA for kicking her off right before her party next week?\n\nUpdate: Sorry for the long time before the update I tried to forget about it. With how this season has gone I decided to wait until this last episode to cut her off. It should be glorious. Also I told all my coworkers and friends that they should come to my place for the last episode.

(Now, her and my dad will have 9 kids to their name.)\n\nBy the time the child is born, I will be a late teen, and step moms oldest would be about 33. I feel like this child will not have the life it deserves, with almost all it's half siblings grown up, moved away, and working on their own lives. \n\nI also cannot imagine my dad parenting again, as he has not had a good relationship with my sister and I for a few years. Further, he refuses to discuss anything important with us. When he remarried, we were told jack, and he is not willing to have a heart to heart or even a short discussion with us about what he's doing.  With the new child, he is doing the same. My sister and I feel abandoned and pushed to the side. \n\nAre we being selfish? Or do we just make do/ ignore it and live our lives? \n\n\nEdit: I don't live with father and stepmom full time.

Just that he ignores talking about important things when they already happen.\n\nEdit 2: just a few things for clarification. 4 of the step kids live across the country, so no, I hardly know them.

On all public transport, there is a sign that says \u201cno eating, drinking, smoking, listening to music without headphones\u201d. Nobody enforced this unless someone\u2019s being annoying.

Mick has contracted both genital and oral herpes from an unfortunate drunk hook up years ago. \n\nHe was upset afterwards that the girl didn\u2019t warn him beforehand - which I believe is relevant for the story. \n\nHe\u2019s been wanting to get back into dating and told me that women tend to unmatch him immediately when he mentions his STDs. It\u2019s understandably frustrating, but I felt it\u2019s good on him for being upfront about it. \n\nThat changed with his last tinder encounter. Mick told me she\u2019s a great girl - pretty, funny, witty. He was *really* excited about going on a date with her and I assumed he had told her about his herpes situation (as he with other girls before). \n\nWe arranged a double date, Mick and Tinder Girl, as well as my partner and I. Things went well in the beginning, we were having a great time and I could definitely feel the chemistry between the two. \n\nHowever, here\u2019s where I might have been an asshole: Mick and my partner went outside for a cigarette, so Tinder Girl and I were the only ones at our table. We ended up talking about Mick, and I mentioned how excited he had been about the date, especially since he hadn\u2019t exactly been lucky on tinder so far. She couldn\u2019t see why, since he was great guy and she enjoyed the date so far. \n\nMind you, we\u2019ve had a few drinks at this point and I told her that he\u2019s had a lot of girls unmatch him due to his \u2018situation\u2019. She was confused and asked me what I meant, so I told her that I meant his herpes. \n\nShe got upset and told me that he hadn\u2019t told her, despite her specifically asking about STDs. Apparently, Mick claimed to be entirely clean. \n\nShe thanked me and stormed out, sending Mick an angry message and later blocking him.\n\nMick said I ruined his chances of scoring that night and is *really* upset with me. He said it was not my place to say anything and I should\u2019ve given him the chance to tell her - but honestly I don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve (given that he specifically lied about it on tinder when she asked). I feel bad, at the same time I think she deserved to know beforehand. \n\nI genuinely wish for Mick to have successful dates, but not through being deceitful. It wasn\u2019t on purpose, I assumed he had told her prior to this - but maybe I do suck for even bringing it up? \n\nSo, reddit: AITA?", "I know it sounds bad but please hear me out. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll try to keep it simple.  English isn't my first so bare with me\n\nI (27 F) am currently 3 month pregnant and in my family it is tradition that a baby shower is thrown at 3 Months, so me and my husband (29 M) are getting ready to throw a baby shower for me.  The thing is that I don't really want my SIL to come because plenty of times in the past, she made a show about her infertility issues. \n\nWhen I first announced that I was pregnant during a family dinner at his side, everything was fine.  I was aware of SIL's personal issue but I didn't think that it required me to go speak to her privately or anything. When his relatives started to ask about baby gender and such, she bursted out crying and started to talk about how she wanted a child but couldn't have one ect.  I felt so bad but my husband assured me that it wasn't my fault and that it was just a rough moment for her. I understood and always tried to not mention my pregnancy around her. But then it was like the moment that anyone asked \"hows the kicker?\" or \" congrats on the baby! \" she would suddenly burst in tears again. I felt bad for thinking like this at first but I noticed a pattern where she would be perfectly fine with a single person asking me about baby names, but as soon as more people started to ask things, she sudden felt off. \n\nBecause of this I had a talk with my husband and explained that I don't think it would be a good idea to invite SIL to the babyshower and how she always had a show when there was a bunch of people. Husband said he understood but that I should talk to SIL first. A few days I asked SIL if I could talk to her in person and we met up in a cafe and I explained my concerns by saying \"I know your fertility is a really sensitive issue, and I'm going to have a babyshower soon and you always get uncomfortable and cry, and I don't think it's a good idea you come since you always cry at the end\". She got angry and blew up at me saying that I was being a \"pregnant bitch\" and that I was being \"an insensitive bitch\". I tried to explain that I meant no harm but she cursed me off and has now told the family (her side)  what happened. I felt fucking awful \n\nThey're not mad at me but think I should just apologize to SIL and stop talking about my pregnancy around her and should have a different idea than a babyshower, the thing is that I don't mind apologizing (I didn't mean to make her feel bad) but I don't want my change my babyshower to another kind of event.

I don't see a car so I keep pulling back into it. The girl gets behind my car and tries to physically stop me from pulling back so I just slow down to a crawl and slowly keep pulling back. She then comes to my passenger door and tries to open it, but luckily my doors were locked.

She proceeds to get in my face and keep screaming at me. \"Do you get off on being an asshole?\" \"Do you realize what a piece of shit you are?\" \"Our friends are right down the road, we're saving this spot for them.\" I pay my meter, take a picture of them and say \"I've got your faces, don't fuck with my car.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for taking this spot that the couple was physically trying to prevent me from taking?

I was only allowed to wear pink baby blue and red. Worst it all had to be one color and the same 2 outfits. A polo shirt with a skirt or a sweater with a long dress. No winter jackets or pants which wasn't a big deal because I live in NC but still. I also had to wear pigtails all the time. I had to wear this outfit at all times except when in bed.\n\nMy parents are divorced and when I went to my dad's she would force me to send her pictures of myself every hour or so and if I wasn't dressed up to her standard she would ground me for two weeks when I went back to her house.\n\nEventually I had a breakdown around 16 and to make a long story short I ended up living with my dad and basically visiting my mom every once in awhile. \n\nAround this time I got into the whole Industrial cyber goth thing. Ended up dying my hair black, wearing all black and getting a ton of piercings. I was like this for rest of High School.\n\nEventually started adding more color to my outfit. Iike white and purple and ended up becoming a bit less goth but black is still my favorite color.\n\nWhen I visit my mom now I make sure to be as goth as possible and sometimes go overboard like painting my skin white and stuff.

My brother will never be able to live on his own, as he is mentally challenged. In the last ten years, he has become morbidly obese.\n\nWhen I say morbidly obese, the last time I was told his weight, he was 634 pounds. He has visibly gained since then. He cannot be weighed on a normal scale. He has to have ultrasounds to get IVs, he breaks any furniture he sits on, he can\u2019t control himself around food, he can\u2019t eat at restaurants because nowhere has seating that he fits on.\n\nIf it were just his weight, it wouldn\u2019t matter. But he is so disgusting, it\u2019s repulsive to be around him. This makes me sound like TA, but he goes weeks without showers, refuses to brush his teeth, has yeast infections on his body, he is sometimes incontinent due to his size, and he cannot wipe properly. Most people cannot be in the same room as him because of his smell. \n\nI spent my entire childhood and teenage years taking care of him or trying to (all the abuse and neglect, I was the one it fell on) However, as we got older my mother decided I was no longer in charge of him. He started gaining all the weight, I\u2019d get punished for trying to control his food, I\u2019d get punished for telling him to shower or clean after himself. My mother and I had countless fights as she was letting him spiral out of control. I even tried getting social services involved. \n\nSo here we are present day. I now live 1700 miles away from him and my mother, but we are flying back to their area for our wedding. \n\nI just can\u2019t stand the thought of him being at my reception. How could he even be there? We have no idea what kind of venue we want yet, but we would most likely have to make it fit for him. I would have to buy him new clothes (which are EXPENSIVE in his size), I would have to come over the day of the reception to make sure he\u2019s clean. \n\nAnd the most selfish reason, which very well might make me TA, is I don\u2019t want all of my friends and fianc\u00e9s family to be distracted by him. Everywhere he goes people stare, and I know this would be no exception, especially considering fianc\u00e9s family has never met him and has no idea what he\u2019s like. It might make me a terrible person, but I don\u2019t want to spend my special day watching everyone gawk at my brother, because honestly you don\u2019t see a 700+ pound man every day. \n\nI feel terrible for not wanting to invite him. I love him, I looked after him my whole childhood. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll be crushed if I say he can\u2019t come, and I wouldn\u2019t even know how to tell him this.\n\nWIBTA to gently tell him it wouldn\u2019t work out for him to be there?\n\nEDIT: In a comment below I replied explaining his extreme behavior\n\nEDIT: I hadn\u2019t thought of another smaller gathering that would work better for my brother, but lots of people are suggesting great things and we are currently planning a separate celebration that\u2019s accommodating to him specifically!", "This happened several months ago, was speaking about it to a friend so wondering whether I was the AH.\n\nI (20M) in college. Several months ago a student group on the campus was doing some protest regarding sexism or something, some activist crap like that. I'm not politically involved in anything, doesn't interest me. I just go to class, party and work out.\n\nSo I was walking to class one day and this protest was blocking my way to class. They were physically blocking people from going to class. I try going another way and there's a protester there, who looks to be about 19 year old dude.\n\nI tell him ''Get out of my way, I'm going to class'' and he starts rambling incoherently about whatever the fuck it is he's protesting. I say it again and he says ''No'' and starts rambling. \n\nI just look him in the eye and say ''Dude, get the fuck out of the way. NOW, or I will call the cops''. He looks a bit scared, at that point I knew this kid didn't know jack shit about anything, was frightened at the mention of cops. He gets out of my way and I go to class. No issue.\n\nNow yesterday I was talking to a friend (20F) about this and she called me out for being an asshole. She said I shouldn't have done that as these issues are important. I said I don't give a fuck, my parents are paying for me to go to class and that's what I'm going to do. AITA?\n\n**Edit - people bringing up my race, not sure why its relevant. I'm an Asian male, if that makes any difference. I got to College to study as my #1 priority and I hold a 4.0 GPA. The little free time I do have, is either on working out (to relieve stress) or partying (to have fun).**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Edit #2 - Wow nearly 2000 comments....seems like there's a strong NTA consensus. Thank you Reddit and double thanks for Gold. I will try to read as many comments as I can.**", "We have broken up now. But my ex boyfriend(22) was the pickiest eater. And I mean absolutely refused to eat certain foods.\n\nFor example , he loves pesto, but he does not know what it\u2019s made out of, because it\u2019s green and he won\u2019t like it after he knows what it\u2019s made out of (basil).\n\nHe has no allergies and he is diabetic, so I would encourage him to eat healthier or atleast some vegetables. I have been at family dinners with his family and his mother would serve these amazing stuffed bell peppers . And he would only scoop the rice and eat that alone.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t mind eating junk food all day, chicken nuggets, burgers ect.\n\nSo one night at my house , I had made lasagne (with small carrot pieces in it) and I served mine with some steamed vegetables including steamed carrots and served his as just lasagna.\n\nMid dinner I feel like he is eyeing my plate so I ask \u201cwould you like to try some of my carrots\u201d to which he replied \u201cnah I don\u2019t like carrots\u201d \ud83e\udd22\n\nI had told him there is carrot in the lasagna. He pushes away the plate and says he\u2019s finished eating (but at this point he had already had 2 servings of it, working on his 3rd)\n\nHe later told me he felt violated that I fed him carrot without his knowledge and was quite upset about it.\n\nI had just been trying so hard to deal with his pickiness, as always having to cater our dinners to his liking and everyone is entitled to have likes and dislikes but I felt it was all in his head and quite irrational.\n\nTL:DR\nex boyfriend only likes food if he doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s made of. Ate food found out what it was made of, felt I violated his trust\n\nEdit: also given the fact that he only disliked it after he knew what was in it. Would it have been any worse if I had just not told him what was in it? I feel like if he knowingly knows he doesn\u2019t like what pesto is made out of simply because it\u2019s green, but it continues to be one of his most liked foods , where is the line ? \n\nEdit2: I would like to also point out that in the previous months we had been agreeing on trying new foods atleast once a week, so I would get to go to cook some of my home made Vietnamese food, or eat out at somewhere that\u2019s not five guys burgers and fries\n\nLast edit : thanks guys I appreciate the input. I understand from a standpoint that what I did wasn\u2019t necessarily respectful to him. I will say that, I still don\u2019t fully understand the full impact of it, but I don\u2019t necessarily feel terrible about what I did. HOWEVER, I do agree perhaps I could have taken some extra measures to handle it a different way. As suggested not date the guy , ( boy, don\u2019t I wish I did that sooner rather than later) or just have him cook his own food.\n\nBut now I\u2019m all the wiser \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nOk real last edit : \nI\u2019d like to address a few things if I may. \n\nIt was my first reddit post in AITA , so sorry some things may have been left a little vague I just didn\u2019t think I should include a whole relationship breakdown\n\nNo I did not know he didn\u2019t like carrots, I did not leave that out to gain sympathy. I just thought it would have been obvious. He asked after he ate to which I informed him.\n\nHe and I were in a long distance relationship . He was from New York and I am from Australia. So the time we got to spend with eachother in real time was quite minimal , so you would have to forgive me for not knowing exactly what he will and won\u2019t eat over Skype. So I apologise that I don\u2019t have his exact list of no go foods. \n\nI in no way intended it in ill will or to \u201cbetter his health\u201d for him. I was just making lasagna. No second thought.\n\nHe has had diabetes for 7 years. He eats copious amounts of snacks including extremely high carb foods. Ie breaded chicken schnitzel, mash potato, fries. But who am I to judge. He just compensated by administering more insulin.\n\nIn our relationship he\u2019s filled me in one what\u2019s more \u201charmful\u201d for his diabetes, so I\u2019m aware that I was more worried about the layers of lasagna strips were going to effect him far more than any carrot would. \n", "My ex-girlfriend (20F) and I (20M) broke up a few months ago. It was a less-than-ideal breakup, she really didn't want us to be separated. For relevance, my ex wanted to continue to follow me on social media (I didn't care that she did, I wanted her to see I was moving on so she should too).\n\nAnyway, I recently got back out in the dating game. I started seeing a black girl (I am white). I posted a picture of her on my SnapChat during a hike captioned \"Isn't she lovely \\*heart-eye emoji\\*\"\n\nMy ex then 'chatted me' with the picture on Snap a bunch of crazy, racist bullshit. She said things like \"Monkey out of the zoo?\", \"You're gay now?? Seeing a guy?\", \"Stupid chimp go back to Africa\", \"Beautiful, where is this? Watermelon Falls?\"\n\nAnyway, this infuriated the hell out of me so I screen-shotted it and just posted it EVERYWHERE. Literally. My snap story, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, *everywhere*. I even tagged her family and close friends so they could all see it because I was so full of rage. \n\nBut now that I had a few days to relax, I feel kinda shitty. Her whole family (and her) apologized and asked me to take it down (Facebook deleted it for 'violating their terms of service which is where most of the family saw it). I originally refused then but have since removed it. I feel like I let my emotions get the best of me for some reason, but the racist tirade was so uncalled for I couldn't control myself. \n\nMy girlfriend was neutral for it mostly, she was of course upset but understood how unstable my ex was. She also said it would be wise just to just remove it, and then block my ex on everything. \n\nSo guys, AITA for putting a racist rant by my ex for everyone to see??????", "I (24M) recently showed up 'unsolicited' to a couples event my fianc\u00e9e (27F) was invited to 'in a professional capacity'. She is currently very pissed at me.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e is an attorney. She's been working at a firm for some time since graduating law school. Every year the local bar association organizes this event where attorneys from the area are invited to network and see some old palls from college. The invitation also goes out to the partner of said attorney.\n\nLast year I went together with her and had a merry good old time. I saw some guys there, who also work at her firm, that frequent the performance engine shop where I work as a mechanic. We share similar interests and we pretty much hit it off immediately (we still hang out every now and then). The event got pretty rowdy towards the end (contrary to popular belief a lot of these attorney types aren't the goody two-shoes they pretend to be) and I (amongst others) ended up on stage singing to classics such as Journey's 'Don't stop believin'' (fucking love that song). \n\nHowever, my fianc\u00e9e ended up experiencing that night very differently. She pretty much went off by herself during the entire thing. She told me she spent the night networking with a few established attorneys and some old acquintances. She also told me she got a bit embarassed by my actions towards the end and that she would like to put on a professional demeanor in front of her colleagues and expected that of me too. \n\nNow, mind you, we often go off the deep end in the weekends and she doesn't have a problem with me acting like the fool I am then!\n\nSo last week when I mentioned how excited I was to go with her again this year, she flat out rejected me! She told me I wouldn't be able to properly behave myself in front of her fellow members of the bar and that was that. I tried promising her that I would be on my best behavior, but \"No means no!\" was the final answer. \n\nWhy would you be embarassed of going to an event with your significant other just for being the person he is? Certainly if that very partner promises to be as innocent as grace itself! The event is literally meant for couples...\n\nInitially I wasn't gonna go, but my newfound friends whatsapped me and I thought \"to hell with it\". So I got there early, joined up with them (saying she was gonna run late), texted her, had a few drinks, and when she arrived almost got dragged out of the party. I got stomped into my car with strict guidelines to go home and was whipped into motion! Not wanting to make a scene I drove off, got two honey butter chicken biscuits from whataburger and spent the rest of the night netflixing. Fun times. \n\nA week later she is still pissed as hell at me for not respecting her boundaries. I've been sleeping on the couch since then. In the meanwhile I can sort of find the humor in her not wanting to lose face in front of her fancy pants colleagues because of her 'oddball' (it truly isn't that bad tho) fianc\u00e9. But she still can't.\n\nAITA?", "My younger brother made some wiener-wrapping mistakes with a relatively unstable girl and had a kid when he was 17. For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n", "I'm using a new account because this still hasn't leaked at work I was the one who did this and my reddit is known to my coworkers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, This last week I got a coworker of mine fired for misconduct. I don't feel bad but my coworkers are now up in arms saying who ever did this is an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, my ex-coworker used to be a good friend of mine. I met her when I got a job here about 3 years ago and we hit it off. We were extremely close friends and I had misplaced trust in her. One thing she liked to do was take photos of us together and post them on snapchat and facebook. I never thought much of this and thought she was just sharing what we did like a normal person would do. I was wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a month ago a man randomly reached out to me. He claimed he was my \"girlfriends\" brother and that he had finally tracked me down. Through a long back and forth it turns out that my coworker has been pretending to her family and friends back in her home town that I was her boyfriend. She had a second facebook with her original name on it and had constructed a weird narrative in which I was her boyfriend. She claimed I was \"old fashioned\" and didn't use social media to cover up her lie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is fucking creepy, right? I documented and archived everything and corrected the record with her brother before reporting this all to HR. I didn't feel like confronting her (I honestly didn't feel like talking to her at all) and distanced myself immediately. She picked up on this quickly and started to post on her second facebook that I had broke up with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHR immediately transferred me away from her and kept us apart at all times. I'm guessing they told her what was going on as her facebooks disappeared over night and she began avoiding me like the plague. It was to late though as this monday she was fired for inappropriate behavior. From what HR and others have told me she will never be working in the field again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHR has kept this as quite as possible and has not leaked any details to anyone. The only thing my other coworkers know is that another coworker reported her for misconduct out of work and she got fired. Most on them are angry about this. The current opinion is that who ever did this is a spineless asshole who just ruined a girls career for \"nothing\". I'm never going to come out about this and have asked HR to never mention me because of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? I feel what she did was wrong and she deserved it but am I wrong?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit/More info:\n\nSince this question has come up, i'll explain a little of my relationship to her. We were strictly friends. There was nothing romantic or sexual between us at least as far as I could tell. I am somewhat a bit naive sometimes ((like using :hit it off\" without realizing it's romantic connotation) but there was nothing there but friendship. We were good friends (from what I thought at least) and hung out quite a bit together. But like I said, there was nothing between us but friendship.\n\nAlso, some have asked why I wen't straight to HR and did not talk to her On her \"real\" facebook she had used my real name and identifying information about me, this is how her brother tracked me down. This fake relationship stretched back 2 years and had very personal information and facts I shared with her in confidence along with very weird constructed situations she had made. One example was a picture I had sent to her while at home sick  she then turned into a dramatic story about how I was in the hospital and she was caring for me. Another is how she took a story I told about my valentines date and replaced my then girlfriend with herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is why I went to HR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should also clarify one thing. When I say her original name, I mean she changed her name legally but did not tell her family to separate her current life from the one she lived on her original facebook.", "With all jokes aside, I am a vegan. Not by choice though. I have some digestion issues where my body can't process most food correctly. I must have a strict diet and the vegan is a good way to actually eat food without getting nutritions through a tube. \n\nMost of the vegan stereotypes ain't true. I and most of my friends don't harass people for their choices on what they eat. Your life, your body. Do whatever. Just please be respectful to the animals etc. Most...some of us won't have a meltdown if there a piece of cheese on my food.\n\nWith all that said, I do have a few friends who are those hardcore stereotype vegans who would walk into restaurants yelling meat is murder or would block as well lecture people why they're destroying the world and animals are friends while people are trying to get burgers for a 4th of July party. \n\nI and my friend in question had heated debates to the point we both turn red everytime on what to feed our pets. We both have two dogs. I feed my dogs what is recommended by the veterinarian. I completely understand they have different needs than people. My friend the other hand, feeds them a vegan diet as she believes it can be good for them as well. \n\nEvery time we hang out, her dogs look so sickly. They never have the energy to play even though they both are about a year old. Give or take. For the last three months, they got worse. They walk around looking confused, lost interest in everything and lost so much weight. Last week I called SPCA and law enforcement because the dog would not move even if you push them. The cops came by and took the dogs away. \n\nThe group of friends is split down the middle of what I did. Some say we waited too long and others are saying I'm an asshole. I do feel bad for my friend. Disregard the diet, she loves those dogs and did care for their wellbeing. She hasn't stop crying or said a word to me. I felt maybe I could've done something different before I called the cops. Maybe I could've taken the dogs myself and/or have her talk to medical professionals about dog's health needs but I was so angry when I last saw the dogs I just had too. Now I feel so guilty. AITA? \n\nIf you would like to know. Her dogs were some type of retrievers. My dogs are a husky and border collie.", "My younger brother Bryan just turned 19 about month ago. About an hour ago, he casually mentioned if I could go get this moscotto (wine) that he likes because he and his girlfriend is celebrating their first year together. He said he needs it by 9 and just expected me to go and get it for him.\n\nI told him I\u2019m not really comfortable giving alcohol to someone whose underaged. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s far or anything (just a couple min drive from my house). But I live in America, so it\u2019s illegal, and call me a straight edge or whatever but I don\u2019t like breaking the law. Additionally, I don\u2019t want to give him the impression that this is something that I\u2019m willing to do often; if I give him alcohol now, he\u2019d expect me to do it again in the future.\n\nI said he can ask our parents but I\u2019m definitely not going to break the law for him. He got pissy and said to \u201cstop being a bitch, who cares?\u201d I said I do, and so I\u2019m not doing it, end of story.\n\nHe texted our parents, and they called me. I expected them to take my side so I put them on speaker phone, but they said they were planning a date night tonight and told me to handle it. I said no and explained why I didn\u2019t want to give my underaged brother alcohol, but they said to \u201cstop being difficult and just give him the damn wine\u201d.\n\nBryan had a shit-eating grin after that and said \u201cI\u2019ll see you before 9\u201d. I went to my car so I guess he assumed I was getting it for him, but instead I just drove to a friend\u2019s house. I group texted Bryan and our parents, and said I wasn\u2019t going to put my livelihood at risk and break the law for anyone, and if anyone had a problem with that, well too bad. I then put my phone on airplane mode and am currently typing this on my computer.\n\nDid I do the right thing? I feel like my brother will be absolutely furious when I turn my phone on, but I feel like he\u2019s acting like a little turd. AITA for how I handled the situation?\n\nUpdate: turned my phone back on. Mom and dad are furious. All Bryan  texted was \"you know, you ruined what was supposed to be a special night and I hope it was worth it.\" Starting to question if I did the right thing...\n\nUPDATE 2: Got home last night. Brother wouldn't even look at me. I sent him a message saying that it wasn't anything against him or anything; I'm just really against the alcohol culture and I felt uncomfortable with the request. All he sent back was \"tbh, i don't really give a shit about your excuses, just leave me alone\". He won't answer any of my calls or texts anymore. My parents are furious for \"being such a square\" and said that between not giving my underaged brother alcohol and not being a legal slave (like forcing myself to do the shit they try to tell me to do e.g.  plant the garden that THEY want or spread the mulch that THEY want), they're genuinely considering kicking me out of the house or forcing me to start paying rent...", "I have been working as a Legal Assistant with a law firm for just over six years and walked off the job yesterday in a fit of a rage.  For these six years, it has been a wonderful relationship -- my employer is a solo practitioner and I was his first and only Legal Assistant until yesterday's events.\n\nMy employer recently hired a new Associate who took it upon herself to treat me like absolute shit.  As a Legal Assistant, my duties are LEGAL related, ie; editing and drafting documents, calendar management, processing client payments, filing documents at court, phone coverage, etc.  However, the new Associate assigned me her PERSONAL duties:  Grocery shopping, driving across town in traffic to buy her favorite chocolates, making returns to clothing stores, driving to her house to let maintenance technicians in, etc.  She yelled at me a lot.  I would get panic attacks and dreaded coming in to work.  I would have no problem performing these duties if I was a PERSONAL Assistant, but I am a LEGAL Assistant and my objective is to ensure everyone in my firm has their LEGAL responsibilities in order.\n\nAt first I obliged, seeing as she was new and I figured my employer would have a word with her.  This went on for two months and every day I grew that much more resentful.  Finally, I had a private meeting with my supervisor a few weeks ago and even typed up a note detailing my frustrations and how I am being taken advantage of.  He promised me he would speak with her, but her demands continued.\n\nYesterday was the last straw; While working at my desk, I overheard her talking about me to our Receptionist.  She wasn't exactly pleasant - stating how I'm not up to par with her standards and how she spoke to my boss about me.  She was telling our Receptionist how much they pay me and said she wants to lower my pay.  My blood started boiling and I could feel myself about to lose my shit.\n\nI have no idea what came over me, but I walked to over to our filing cabinet, pulled out all of our folders, and dumped all of their contents to the floor.  I imagine it was about 40-50 clients worth of papers.  I then grabbed my things and walked out of the office before telling the Associate \"Go fuck yourself, you stupid bitch.\"  She was absolutely shocked.\n\nOn my home, I was seething.  Still pissed off when I got home, I texted my boss saying I will not be returning to work Monday and that he'll have to find himself another Assistant.  Both her and she have tried calling, texting, and e-mailing me, but I haven't responded, except for one text where I sent her the middle finger emoji.  \n\nThis morning I felt a twinge of guilt, as I know it was HER that made me miserable and not him .. but then again, there was no loyalty there.  Fuck you Sweta, I hate you!", "A throwaway since my friends know my reddit account. This conversation happened a few days ago but I\u2019m still getting called TA for it. I (M 21) was hanging out with a good friend of mine (F19) and we started talking about dating. I told her it that as long as the person and I hit it off that\u2019s all that matters to me. She told me that ever since she started liking Korean pop music she\u2019s only been wanting to date Korean guys. She said that they look cleaner and are nicer than men from other races. I told her that you can\u2019t just base it off from guys you only see on TV and that it\u2019s kinda disgusting to fetishize Korean men just because you like Korean music. She said that it\u2019s just a preference and if guys can go after Asian girls all that time why can\u2019t woman go after Asian guys. I told her that it\u2019s fetishizing anyways and she should really rethink her mentality. She stormed out after calling me a \u201cprick\u201d and told everyone in the friend gc. Most sided with her saying that I can\u2019t really judge since it\u2019s just a preference and that I should apologize...AITA?\n\n*Since apparently people are stating that the only reason I\u2019m angry is because I\u2019m not the one she\u2019s attracted to FYI I\u2019M GAY AF", "My sister is 16 and I\u2019m 24. We have conservative parents who discouraged us from drinking or doing anything that would \u201cshame the family\u201d, etc. \n\nI moved out as soon as I could and have done a decent job of distancing myself relatively from my parents. \n\nMy job requires me to work long days so my sleep is really important to me and my sister knows this. \n \nLast night, around 2am, I get a call from my sister and she says that she snuck out of the house and she\u2019s really drunk and at a party with a bunch of older people and she needs me to come pick her up and she gave me the address (which was about 45 minutes away). \n\nI worked this morning at 5am so there was no way I was getting up and picking her up and losing sleep. I told her that she should take responsibility and call our parents to come pick her up. She started pleading with me and crying and begging me to come get her but I told her to call either mom or dad. \n\nShe kept yelling so I just hung up on her. I called my parents and told them where she was and she needed them to come get her. I didn\u2019t think about it again and I fell back asleep. \n\nOn my break this morning I get a call from my parents saying that my sister is grounded and had her phone taken away from her. They thanked me for calling them. \n\nI was talking to my coworker and she said that I was being a little harsh and that I should\u2019ve gone to get her just this once to make sure she was safe. I responded that I called my parents to pick her up and it wasn\u2019t my responsibility to bail her out of a party. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten other opinions that have kind of made it seem as though I was the asshole but I think I did the right thing. \n\nThat said, AITA?", "So girlfriend split up with me a few days ago (I'm 26, she's 25). We will buy out the lease at the end of April but I went to my brothers for the time being until I find a new place. I'm still helping split April's rent and all the furniture and items in the apartment is mine or my families (couch, bed, table, TV, etc). She's definitely free to see other people, that's obvious, but I told her not to bring other guys back to this place because technically it was still my apartment as well and everything in there is mine. I'll more than likely be taking all this furniture come end of April. She accused me of calling her a slut right then and there because I said don't bring guys back but I laughed it off and told her I didn't mean it like that.\n\nWell on Tuesday morning, I had to swing by to snag my roller hockey skates. I walked in and there she was, cuddled up with a guy on our couch only 4 days after breaking up. I wasn't mad, just hurt. I told the guy to leave and then took a few hours of PTO from work and moved basically all the crap I could out of the apartment (my 55 inch TV, speakers, computer, all my clothes, etc). I still left her my 42 inch TV and my firestick to watch Netflix and crap, along with all the furniture for the time being. She kept telling me she won't bring any other guys back and it isn't what I thought it was.\n\nWell, now a few days later, heard from a mutual friend that she has a date with a new guy and she mentioned to my mutual friend that she's bringing the guy back to our place tonight for date #2, Netflix and chill. She told my friend that she doesn't know if they'll have sex yet but she wants too. (I have absolutely no idea why she would tell this to my mutual friend either because it's a girl I've known dating back to pre-k school). So my mutual friend, who was on my side in the beginning, told me this.\n\nNow, sure, it hurts that she is seeing other people only a week after breaking up but she's a free agent. But would I be the asshole for going and moving everything out of that apartment? The thought of her taking it on the bed I will be using for the foreseeable future, in an apartment I'm paying half the rent for, and them using my 42 inch TV and firestick to Netflix it up, is kind of making me sick. \n\nSo what gives. Tell me how it is so I can gain some perspective because I still love this girl and wanted to help her out this month instead of leaving her high and dry. The fact that I love her is obviously blinding my judgment a bit and probably making me a bit resentful to this. But at the same time, I don't want to be walked all over and disrespected. ", "Basically title, my wife was having a lot of pain and her breast ducts were swollen and clogged. Her OBGYN said that pumping could help but nothing is better than the human mouth (i can't believe she used those words but here we are) and she asked if I could help with the process of getting the milk flowing. Now I stepped up and did it, but I got a lot of milk in my mouth (idk if it was really a lot, not like 8oz or anything but there was a a lot for me), and I was doing a combination of sucking and spitting, and after we got the clog, I went to wash my face and brush my teeth. Breast milk is not gross or anything, I just had a weird reaction to the wording of \"unclogging\" which made my stupid brain fail. Anyway my wife was pissed, telling me that \"i think she is unclean\" or \"her milk is not good enough\". We have not slept in a while with new baby, but I don't think I did anything wrong. AITA here?", "I work at a summer camp where you drop your children off in the morning and pick them up in the afternoon after your work. The camp is funded from the state so the parents have to pay only about 30 USD per week while we take care of their children. It is an IT camp, children from 6-15 are taught how to work with 3D printers, build and code lego robots, make youtube videos, use computers, etc. It was required that the children have some sort of relationship to these kind of things or at least take interest in them. \n\nOn wednesday we had a new kid show up because he was sick the first two days of the camp. His mother told me how he's only 6 but he's clever as a 9 year old at least. Also she told me how great he is with technology and how awesome his lego building skills are. I believed her and was very happy that we have such a kid. So I take him to the classroom and show him his computer. That's when he tells me that he doesn't know how to read and has never been on a computer, smarthphone or a tablet - basically everything this camp is about. Well, I gave him some lego robots which he could build. He came to me every 2 minutes saying that it's too hard and he can't do that. So basically there was nothing for him to do for the whole week. \n\nLater when I talked to the owner of the camp he told me that the mother signed him up for two weeks and he allowed it after she told him her lies. I was really pissed at the kid's mother for abusing the price of the camp and using it as a really cheap daycare. Me and the girl who works there with me persuaded the owner to kick the kid from the camp for the next week because there was nothing for him to do and his mother was lying about his skills.  \n\nNow my friend and my girlfriend think that I'm an asshole for this but In my opinion work with children is really exhausting and I can't give all my attention to this kid. So AITA?   \n\n\ntldr; Mother lied about her kid being a second coming of Albert Einstein to get him to IT summer camp. We found out he can't even read and has never used a PC. We kicked him from the next week of the camp.", "My brother, who I have a very strong bond and good relationship with, has been trying for years to get his wife pregnant, all to no avail. It\u2019s believed that he\u2019s sterile, and this saddens him (and me) very greatly. A while ago, they accepted that he is unlikely to ever have biological children, and began looking for a sperm donor. But just recently, they posed a new, unconventional idea to me - that **I** be the donor.\n\nAsking your brother to donate sperm for you might be an odd or even inappropriate request in most circumstances, but ours is a unique one - we are identical twins. We share 100% identical DNA, and thus any child born of my sperm would be related to my brother **every bit as much** as his own child from his own sperm would. This would not be the case with regular brothers, where the baby would be related as a nephew/niece to him. And because of this, the child wouldn\u2019t find out about the \u201cdonation\u201d from one of those home DNA tests so many people are taking now - my brother and I both would show up as the father on any DNA test because of our identical DNA.\n\nMy brother views having an identical twin as a great stroke of luck in this situation, and an opportunity to be able to have his own children after all. Despite his enthusiasm, I\u2019m not so sure about the whole thing. I haven\u2019t officially declined; I just told him that \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d I\u2019m married, and just think the whole thing seems a bit weird and \u201coff\u201d. AITA for not thinking about my brother\u2019s need first and foremost?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts. I\u2019ve thought things over a lot this past day, and have decided that I **am** going to go through with the sperm donation after all, and allow my brother to have a child.", "  \n\nI'm not posting in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) because we already worked through this but my wife still thinks I'm an asshole and I don't so we thought we'd let the internet decide. \n\nMy wife has major lifestyle inflation. Always has. From the first time she got a job, whenever she'd get a raise or come into some money (tax return, bonus, etc.) she'd have it spent on \u201cupgrades\u201d like a new car, new apartment, designer clothes, handbags, trips, etc. We handle our finances together but everything is pretty automated. Our regular bills are on autopay, retirement and  kids' college savings, investments, charities all come out of my paycheck and go into their respective accounts. I make low to mid 6 figures and our only debt is real estate and vehicle related debt so whatever is left after all the auto accounts just goes to everyday expenses. The thing is, my wife manages to spend a lot of it. She spends thousands of dollars a month and whenever I get a bonus it is already spent. I can count on at least two bonuses a year and leading up to that my wife is already planning a kitchen remodel, big trip, landscaping, etc. Whenever I get a raise, she wants to \"upgrade\" the vehicles. Right now she has her eye on a Range Rover (because its somehow better than her Audi and my Volvo). Sometimes, it is small lifestyle inflation- like she does those Stitch Fix boxes for herself, our 3 children, and me (although I asked her to cancel mine and until my deception was found out she hadn't- just kept the clothes she liked for me and put them in my closet). At some point she started doing weekly massages, monthly facials, belongs to three gyms, the list goes on.  \n\nWe would discuss this spending issue but since we can afford it, there was really no leg for me to stand on. I just felt like it was unnecessary spending but couldn't tell her what else we should be doing with the money. About 8 months ago I went to a conference, obtained a new skill and my practice gave me a significant raise because I was the only one who could do this in our office. I did not tell my wife. I just adjusted my paycheck so the exact amount of the raise would now go into a separate savings account (my wife has access to this account but doesn't monitor it). The money accumulated and it felt good and I could start clearly why I liked not spending everything and started thinking that if we cut back on spending I could retire 5-10 years early, we could buy rental properties, or pay off our mortgage. Couple weeks ago my wife requested a copy of my paycheck from our office manager to verify income for something, and saw the net amount didn't match the amount that was being deposited. I came clean, we fought, we talked to our therapist, we came to an understanding, all is good. Except she still thinks I'm an asshole for hiding the raise from her. I think I was not an asshole because I had no ill will and wasn't putting it in a place where she didn't have access to.", "AITA\nI\u2019ll try and keep this short guys, I haven\u2019t found anyone so far who thinks I am in the wrong, so wanted to get Reddit\u2019s verdict.\n\nSo my buddy recently hosted a Christmas roast dinner. About 8 people turned up. Anyway I agreed to go, that was until I heard he was charging people to go. So I turned down the invite, making an excuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford it, I just think it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to invite people over and charge them, he\u2019s not short of money either. I actually think it\u2019s so rude, you either have the night or don\u2019t, charging people is unthinkable to me.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen pictures of the food and he must of made 40 pounds profit from the night.\n\nEDIT - thanks for the responses everyone, I can see most people agree and think I\u2019m NAH for not going.

I'll try to answer the one later today. I have decided to stand up for myself and tell my parents today I want this change to happen. I'm not doing this to hurt my dad. But I think I deserve to feel like I have a home like they do.\n\nEnd update\n\nMy parents got divorced when I was 7. I'm 14 now. For the past three years I've been doing a week at my mom's and a week at my dad's.\n\nMy dad spent a lot of money to get this arrangement. No one even asked me what I wanted.\n\nWell I officially hate this schedule. I hate that I have pack all my stuff every goddamn week.\n\nI don't feel like I fit in with both families. They all get to stay in one place and be happy and I feel like I'm just visiting them.\n\nI don't have anything against my dad. He's a good dad. But I want to stay full time in one spot. I also prefer my mom's house because there aren't little kids (my 5 year old stepsister).\n\nI guess the crappy part is my dad just bought a new house so all the kids could get their own room. I mean, I got the worst room but I guess it's the thought that counts.\n\nAlso, if I stay with Mom full time, my dad will have to pay a lot more money to my mom. This is because my mom doesn't get paid much but my stepdad makes a lot. My dad does make as much money as them.\n\nI told my dad last week and he's really upset. And he's accusing my mom of brainwashing me, which makes me even more pissed off.\n\nAm I the asshole?", " I was in Target the day after Christmas. I live in a large city so it was packed with people returning stuff and the usual shopping. I needed to use the restroom so I went to do that.   \n\n  \n  There was quite a line of people so I decided to act civilized and get in line. The man behind me had a kid (probably like 6 or 7) with him and was getting really upset really fast. While there was about 2 people a head of me a store associate came out and told us he needed a minute to clean the bathroom. Obviously none of use were happy but what are you going to do? The associate goes in the bathroom to clean it up. \n\n  \n  Almost immediately the guy behind me starts complaining very loudly how the worker was probably in there doing nothing and making us wait on purpose. To be fair the associate did take about 10 minutes but the guy was talking loud enough that I think the associate in the bathroom could have heard it fairly clearly. I worked retail so I know how stressed the holidays are on people so I texted my girlfriend telling her it would be a while. I also texted her, \"There is a guy behind me who is acting like a baby about having to wait. He is throwing a little tantrum that is kinda funny.\"     \n \n\n I get out of the text app and start browsing Reddit or something. The guy behind me starts really calling the associate names and generally being an asshole to the young guy who is just doing his job. I turn around and give him a look and he says to me, \"You shut up. I saw what you said about me, asshole.\"   \n \n\n So at this point I'm a little stunned because there must have been an effort to look over my shoulder and see what I was texting. That's kinda a huge violation of privacy in my opinion. I get a little pissed fast and turn to his kid and said, \"Santa Claus is not real. It's your parents. Also the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy are not real. It's all your parents work.\" I walked away at that point because I didn't want a physical altercation to happen or anything.   \n\n\n  Am I the asshole? Maybe what I didn't wasn't proportional but I think it was if you have ever worked retail on the holidays and if I was the associate I would be cheering for me.  \n\n\ntl;dr: Stranger acts like an asshole to retail associate, reads my private text over my shoulder, calls me an asshole for texting that he was being a baby, I tell his kid that Santa isn't real. \n\nEdit 1: Thanks for all the feedback!

He\u2019s a great guy, and I\u2019ve met his three kids, who I also like. The problem is that lately she spends 99% of her time with him and his children, often making me feel abandoned. \n\nMy dad was abusive and lost custody of me recently [18F] , and we just moved to a new town so I don\u2019t have anyone around except for my boyfriend. \n\nToday she invited me to meet her and her bf at a local art fair. After about 10 minutes of me being there she told me she had to leave to pick up her boyfriend\u2019s child from sports practice. I was irritated because I drove all the way over there to see her, but I brushed it off and spent a little while shopping around by myself. \n\nShe got back late tonight (as usual) and I asked her if she could pick me up from work tomorrow as I won\u2019t have a car. She said she couldn\u2019t because she was going hiking with her boyfriend and his family. \n\nHurt at the obvious irony, I said angrily, \u201cSo you won\u2019t pick ME up tomorrow because you\u2019re hanging out with his kids, yet you left me today to pick THEM up?\u201d \n\nI obviously upset her by saying that, and she started crying.

Days or weeks go by and it doesn't get done. I finally give in and do it myself and tell him that I've done it. He says that I was just too impatient and that he was just about to do it. We've talked about this issue several times and he always argues that I'm setting him up for failure by not giving him enough time. I disagree because I think he takes far longer than is reasonable to complete simple tasks. I'm giving him days or weeks to do it, not hours.\n\nSince my husband thinks this is a matter of me not giving him enough time, I decided that the next time I ran into this problem with a non-essential task, I would let him take as long as he needs to get it done and then point out how long it took for him to do it. I honestly feel like this is the only way to get him to understand my point.\n\nWe ran out of paper towels six weeks ago. I asked him to pick up some more next time he went to the store. It hasn't happened. We haven't had paper towels for six weeks. He complains about it constantly, yet he won't buy the damn paper towels. If he makes it to eight weeks without picking up the paper towels, I will do it.\n\nI casually mentioned this to one of my friends and she think I'm being a cruel asshole. She doesn't see why I can't just buy the paper towels. I admit that I know I'm being petty here, but does that make me the asshole?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I realized after I posted that this may be important.

It's been frigid and unbearable outside the past few days and has given myself and dog a case of cabin fever. He's use to having a hour walk on the beach and a few small walks each day. So after 3 days of just small walks and being stuck in the house I wanted to let him stretch his legs. He's a 60 pound German Shorthaired Pointer and loves running.\n\nNow my closest dog park is about a 40 minute ride and I usually don't go too often because it's so far out of the way for me. Keep in mind it's a county run dog park and is only ever closed for maintenance or for use of the county.\n\nWhen I arrived I was excited to see a good amount of cars, sometimes it's hit or miss and you can find yourself there with just 1-2 other dogs. \n\n I walked up to the entrance to the enclosed dog park (which is blocked by trees from the parking lot) and saw the park was loaded with Labradoodles. It was pretty awesome and funny to see about 20-25 Labradoodles in one place.\n\nBefore I even open up the gate to go in I'm told to stop by a dog owner, I do so because I didn't know if there was a nasty dog in the park. This lady goes on to tell me that the park is closed for an event hosted by the ________ County Labradoodle Association. She tells me that I can go to the small dog area down the road (which is roughly the size of two mobile homes, not the 3 acre park I'm at now). \n\nI'm not one for conflict so I kinda laugh and say no thank you (laughing is just a reaction I have when I'm confronted, more of a chuckle). I go to open up the gate and she sticks her foot in the way so I can't open it. She tells me to stop laughing in her face and to go to the small dog area (with my 60 pound dog?). At this point in the conversation we started to get an audience, knowing people were watching she started to get louder and tell me to leave. \n\nI was relieved when another person came over but it turned out to be her husband. He tried telling me they've been organizing this meet up for the past 3 months and put a lot of effort into getting a good turn out. He was trying to be reasonable but I really just couldn't see it for their perspective. \n\nNow this whole time my dog is whining and crying trying to get into the park and other dogs have gathered and are barking at the new comer. The lady flips this on me, and says that im causing an unnecessary scene. A few other owners come along and tell her to let me in. She graciously gives me 10 minutes of time in the park.\n\nMy dog is happier than a pig in sh*t, running around and having a ball. All the time he's under the close supervision of this woman, Rachel and her husband. \n\nNow this is where I may become the a**hole,\napparently she set a timer and proceeds to tell me my time is up. Without even thinking and completely on impulse like a crime of passion I say  \"F*** off you annoying C***.\" That's right, I said the no-no word. The one you're never to call a woman.\n\nI froze and just decided to own it. I walked away and told her to leave me alone. Her husband was not too impressed with what I had to say and came to confront me. Now, they may be older than me (mid 40's) but I'm 27 and sure as hell not a kid.\n\nHe goes on to insist I apologise to his wife and that I need to conduct myself like an adult and not a frat boy. He tells me to do so or face the consequences for my actions, I ask him if he's threatening me, he tells me your damn right I am. I agree to apologise to her. I get my dog and leave without saying a word to her. \n\nI sit in my car and a call the park rangers and tell them the whole situation, they tell me they received two other calls about the incident, previous people getting turned away. So about 20 minutes later 4 trucks of park rangers show up and shut down the park for unscheduled maintenance for about an hour. \n\nReally not the outcome I wanted because because it seemed to only be the one couple and about 4 other people in their posse. I felt like shit because about 15 other people had their outting ruined. So I'm just sitting here in my car waiting for the park to reopen while the rangers do \"maintenance\" and I'm wondering AITA? \n\nTLDR- Denied entry to dog park, allowed to come in for 10 minutes, told to leave, drop the C-bomb, leave and get the park closed for \"maintenance\"\n \n\nEdit: Wow lots of feedback but one question keeps popping up and the answer is, no she did not have a permit for using the park ", "Hi I\u2019m at writing in perspective of my older step cousin .

They aren\u2019t bad enough to be classified as Tourette\u2019s, although they can be slightly annoying at times. My tics include jerking my head to the side, clicking my tongue, clapping, slamming my hands down on a flat surface, and saying loads of random words. Normally I only do one of these and then carry on as normal, but around once a month I get something I refer to as a \u201ctic attack\u201d, where I have non stop tics for around 5 minutes or so. I should also point out that I\u2019m incredibly vulnerable during one of these attacks, as I only have a minimum amount of control over what I\u2019m doing. I can usually control my hands but that\u2019s about it. If someone decided to steal my bag or attack me I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have enough control to defend myself during this. \n\nMy boyfriend studies psychology, and funnily enough he was recently studying Tourette\u2019s and other tic disorders. I gave him permission to film one of my tic attacks, so that he could show his psychology teacher/class, as they don\u2019t actually get to see what tics are like. We agreed that when I got the attack, I would give him a thumbs up if it was okay to film. A few days later I get an attack while we are hanging out with friends, give him the thumbs up, he films part of it and all is good. \n\nNow a few days later, I get another tic attack. This is unusual to have them this close together, so I\u2019m already a little startled at it. Then I notice that a friend has pulled out her phone and started filming me, while laughing slightly. I can\u2019t do anything while I\u2019m ticking, but as soon as it\u2019s over I ask her what the fuck she was doing.\n\u201cOh well you let your boyfriend film last time so it\u2019s obviously fine.\u201d\nI\u2019m pissed as hell, I explain that I had explicitly given him permission for his class, but that doesn\u2019t mean I gave her permission. I told her to delete the video.\n\u201cNo, if you agreed once then it\u2019s fine all the other times. If you don\u2019t like it then you shouldn\u2019t have agreed the first time\u201d.\nI completely lost my shit. I yelled at her that it was an extreme violation of my privacy, that she should ask every time, and that me agreeing once doesn\u2019t mean I agree every time. She eventually deleted it, but is now telling everyone that I went back on my word and that I double crossed her.\n\nA lot of people have told me that I should have let her keep the video, as it was harmless fun and my boyfriend already filmed it anyways. While at the time I thought I was right, I'm now wondering if I overreacted because I was startled and stressed out. AITA for yelling and telling her to delete it?\n\nEdit: so the general consensus I\u2019m getting here is that I need better friends \ud83d\ude02. I am leaving in September for university and have decided that I\u2019m definitely going to be cutting her off, as well as some of the people who tried to defend her. I posted this as I\u2019m autistic and had no idea if I\u2019d crossed a line/broken a social rule, or if I was justified. Also to be clear, everyone in this story is around 17/18, in our last school year before uni. I know teenagers can be crappy af sometimes and it feels like this is one of those cases.\n\nEdit number 2: a couple people have messaged me to let me know my symptoms sound like full blown Tourette\u2019s. While I did originally go to a GP, he wasn\u2019t very sympathetic and did not refer me to a neurologist as he said it wasn\u2019t enough symptoms. Once I move and have a new GP, I will go and try get a referral, if only to see if there\u2019s anything else I can do to manage these tics better. Thank you all for your advice, I\u2019m fairly shy so I don\u2019t think I would have ever gone back without people altering me that this is unusual! (I mean obviously tics are unusual, but I assumed that if the GP said I didn\u2019t have an issue then it was fine)", "My best friend is getting married to his second wife, who was his mistress when he was still married to his first wife. He asked me to be his best man and I refused.\n\nI told him that didn't want to do it because it felt like supporting their 'regularized' adultery. It was found out that he had been cheating on his late wife with his current fiancee for years. His wife died last year, now he is free to marry his mistress and wants me to be there to celebrate with him? It just feels wrong.\n\nHe was disappointed and said that he just wants his best friend to be there for him, not to judge him. He also defended that the fact that they had a relationship while he was still married is irrelevant because they are both single now and are free to marry each other. Furthermore, I didn't even like his late wife that much.\n\nYeah, I didn't like her, but that doesn't mean I would have supported my best friend cheating on her and that doesn't mean I'll feel comfortable watching him get married to his former mistress.\n\nEdit because I'm getting tired of explaining myself. \n\nI consider him my best friend because we have known each other for 20 years and were really the best of friends during that time. \n\nWhen I learned about his affair, I gave him a piece of my mind about what a POS he is for cheating on his wife and told him I would never look at him the same again. \n\nA lot of people cut him off after learning of the affair. I would have done that also but he lives far from family and has three young children who are suddenly without their mom. We live five minutes away. If he needed someone to look after the kids because he was meeting with his lawyer or working late, of course I didn't say I hate the fact that you cheated so I'm cutting you out of my life.\n\nI help him and check on him and the kids but we don't hang out socially because as I said I can't look at him the same. Which is probably more than our other friends have done because they cut him off. \n\nThe kids have been adjusting and I am helping them out and checking on them less these past few months.", "I definitely feel like the asshole but here we go.\n\nI\u2019m number 4 out of 8 kids in a blended family. Because of this, I\u2019ve never had my own party. Number 7 and number 6 have their birthdays within a 5 day period before mine, and since they go first and they\u2019re younger I don\u2019t even get to pick cake flavor. Last year I opened birthday cards at the kitchen table alone and only my parents and one sibling gave me a gift because the household gets tired of birthdays by the time mine roles around. \n\nNumber 8 has never had that issue as she is the only child who has a birthday in June. Additionally, she has 7 older siblings, is the only member of my household to be blood related in some manner to every single other member, and our parents had her at age 40 so they get exhausted with her antics very quickly. As consequence, she usually ends up getting whatever she wants from someone or another after a tantrum or two. \n\nI graduate high school two days before her birthday and she\u2019s started demanding that I \u201cshare\u201d my grad party with her. In theory I wouldn\u2019t mind and I feel awful saying no to a second grader, but I don\u2019t want her little friends underfoot, I don\u2019t want birthday candles on the cake that I got to pick out, I don\u2019t want everyone to be focused on giving her gifts and forgetting about me again, and I don\u2019t want her monopolizing attention. I know high school isn\u2019t a big deal but I\u2019ve had some significant mental health problems throughout in the past couple years and I\u2019m very proud of how well I\u2019ve done. Am I the asshole for wanting my accomplishments acknowledged, even at the expense of a little kid\u2019s feelings?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that I told her that I didn\u2019t want to let her share and our mother got upset with me because \u201cnow everyone has to listen to her cry about it\u201d", "Throwaway:\n\nMy (29f) g-parents had 3 kids, my dad was the middle child he passed away when I was 19. I am an only child, there are 6 g-children total. My g-pa died around 2 years ago. My g-ma died around 4 years ago. In the final Will it was stipulated, each g-child gets a set amount, and each child gets a set amount. In this Will, it also states that if their child predeceased them, then their share goes to any children they have. (So I got my share, plus my fathers).\n\nThis is not a small amount, but I'm not multimillionaire either. Of the other g-children, I'm considered the \"least successful\" in that I have my associate\u2019s degree and work as a legal assistant. I have a dog, and live independently in an apartment near my job. My other cousins all are very wealthy, with advanced degrees and multiple kids each. I have 1 cousin though, who is successful but lives way beyond his means, and mooches off his parents (my dad's sister & husband) when bill collectors come around. I will 100% admit, he had a rough life, his father left when he was a kid, and his mom remarried a lot and my g-parents basically raised him. So it all came as a shock to him, when he only received the amount of us \"other\" cousins. So much so, that he tried to contest the Will. it took a year and at least 1/3 of his inheritance only for him to be disappointed in the end.\n\nAfter talking it over with my Mom, and my boss, I've decided to take a leave of absence from work, (I've been there about 5 years, and have a very close relationship with my boss). I'm taking this time to do some travelling, and physically work on myself (losing that pesky 30 lbs that haunts me). Me and THAT cousin live in the same area of town, and go to the same gym. Always have gotten along, but he loves to make those snide comments, I started avoiding him about a year or so ago, but now that I have more free time, I have run into him a few times. He finally approached me with a \"Why are you here during the day??\" I told him that I am between jobs now (instead of admitting I left voluntarily) And once again got a \"Must be nice with all that money lying around\" After 2 years of hearing these comments, I'll admit I finally kind of snapped. Replied: \"Well, lets just remember how I got this money, wanna trade your mom's life for it?\" I'll admit it was a low blow, but at the same time, I only have this money because my father is DEAD. Just because he feels entitled to my grandparents money, doesn't give him the right to constantly remind me that I got a large share of it, I had to pay my own price for it. Anyways, he told me to \"fuck off\" and stormed away. I have not seen him since. When I told my mother, she was quite angry with me, reminding me his own father abandoned him. I still don't think I did anything wrong, but maybe I did...AITA?\n\nEdit: To answer some repeat questions or comments: This cousin was raised from about 2-13 or so by my grandparents, but around 13 decided to go back to his mom and her then husband whom he got along with. Then, when my grandmother died 4 years ago (he was in his mid 30's) he started hanging around my grandpa again. I would not say he's closer than any of the rest of us. We ALL visited my grandpa, and he led a very active life until the end, I'd say other than the out of state cousin, we all saw him once a week or so. He just started acting overly nice and helping him out more, etc.  Also, he used the logic that he was more of a child to the grandparents, and that my fathers share should be split between the two Aunts (which is why the one got dragged in), which would have happened if I didn't exist. As for my mom, her and my dad were married 24 years and were still together when he passed away. I DID try to give the money to my mom, she wouldn't take it, nor was she willing to split it because \"In a few years, Medicaid will come for that money, and I'd rather it be yours\" I have a large chunk (over half) set aside for her so that I can make sure she is taken care of in her later years, but she's 64 and more active/healthy than most 20 year olds I know! She is also going on some of these trips we have planned, all expenses paid. If my cousin hadn't been such a jerk these last 2 years about everything, I would have considered funding a large family trip. But, me and my mother think now that the true colors have been shown, it's best to leave it.", "EDIT: Update Below. Thank you all for your comments and advice! I appreciate your input regardless of where you stand. \n\nI come from three generations of jewelers and though my family is no longer in the business, I still enjoy buying and selling loose gemstones for my own collection or to be set into custom pieces. I am extremely close to my husband\u2019s family and I have either cheaply sold or simply given them stones/rings to propose to their significant others. \n\nMy oldest brother-in-law has been dating his girlfriend for the past six years and while they are both a piece of work to say the least, they\u2019re family so we tolerate them in doses. While we talk to and visit the other in-laws on a weekly basis, these two only come around when an event is going on or when they need money.... and they alway need money. My pending sister-in-law, while sweet at times is mostly bratty, tacky, spoiled and loud. She usually is the source of drama and my current headache at the moment. \n\nEvery first Saturday of the month, the family hooks up for breakfast. Things started off normally today but they announced that finally, they were ready to tie the knot. We all had genuine excitement and breakfast turned into a boozy celebration. Then near the end while everyone is waiting for the check, they ask if they can come back to the house to pick out a ring. \n\nJust like that. Mic drop. It shocked me because they didn\u2019t ask, he didn\u2019t come to me or hubby beforehand to see if it was even a possibility. AND while I do have some options, I did not appreciate the assumption that I was going pull diamonds out of my ass without any discussion and straight up said no. I\u2019d be willing to help them find something at their price point commercially. My inner Smaug woke up. \n\nAll hell broke loose. She straight up throws a fit and begins calling out my other sister-in-laws who did have help from me with their rings and of course they are embarrassed. It\u2019s not something we just talk about and I don\u2019t hang it over anyone\u2019s head. Brother-in-law starts trying to pick a fight with my husband telling him that he needs to \u201ccheck me.\u201d All of this is driving home that my on the spot decision was the right one. \n\nDrama apparently wants to have it\u2019s day because while most of the table is trying to diffuse this until we can leave the restaurant, my mother-in-law of all people throws rocket fuel on the dumpster fire by saying that I\u2019m being selfish and that there\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t help. She and I have had our differences in the past (during my and my husband\u2019s crazy/horny teenage years) but haven\u2019t openly feuded since we\u2019ve been adults. \n\nBeing the superhero that he his, my husband got us TF out of there but since this morning, we have been ignoring our phones as this plays out. We\u2019re both pissed. \n\n\u2014Update:\n\nThis took up my whole Saturday. MIL and FIL came over in person to talk about what happened. FIL agreed that BIL and future SIL were out of line and apologized in their behalf. \n\nOnce this came out of his mouth, MIL had a meltdown. She still believed that a ring was deserved and even after explaining my reasoning basically said that, \u201cI set a standard and since they can not afford it on their own, it was MY responsibility to step up.\u201d I nearly lost it with her but instead of giving back all the venom that I\u2019d been choking on, I left the house. \n\nFIL came outside and helped me calm down while she and Hubs talked. I haven\u2019t gone in depth of how this affected things IRL but the fallout spread fast. The family has been through a lot recently and I did not want this to add more into the pot even though pettiness was strong within me. \n\nBetween talking to him and texting my husband at ground zero, I actually decided to compromise. I have a pear shaped moissanite that I bought out of curiosity but did nothing with after it started trending a few years ago. For those who do not know, moissanite is a popular alternative to diamonds. It\u2019s just been sitting in my collection and I figured why the fuck not. I could actually give them something and be done with it all providing that apologies were made to myself, the other inlaws and that they got it set on their own. FIL did not want me to offer it at first but I explained why and he reluctantly agreed. \n\nHe called BIL, shred him for a moment but eventually told them my terms. I got on the line and explained what the moissanite was, the weight and cut since I had no idea what her preferences were. Other in-laws chose stones that weren\u2019t traditional as well so I wanted to make sure she even wanted what I offered. They did. The change in their attitudes felt like this was the right choice. I told them to just come on over. Once they got here, they immediately apologized and Hubs got MIL to do the same though he gave me the worst side eye the whole time. Showed them the stone and future SIL just starts squirting tears out of happiness. I\u2019m a big softy. Honestly, If things hadn\u2019t gone down they way they did, I would have cried with her. \n\nI gave her the stone\u2019s certification after the waterworks and things did a compete 360. She and BIL went from loving it to being offended that the damned thing wasn\u2019t a diamond even though I\u2019d explained this when giving the specs on the phone! She was actively FaceTiming her HER mom showing her the stone on her hand which lead to them calling me a horrible person for getting their hopes up. BIL stops short of insulting me again as Hubs stepped in and instead says that I\u2019ve disrespecting his fianc\u00e9 the whole time. MIL actually had the audacity to demand that SHE will pick out a \u201creal stone\u201d and to see what else I have like I\u2019m a fucking sales clerk; not in my own house. Here I am staring at this twilight zone clusterfuck as they start arguing and I\u2019m just standing in my kitchen watching it all play out again.\n\nI have reached levels of real anger before but I think this was the first time I could say I felt actual fury. They pushed me to fulfill my lifelong dream to scream at people to get the fuck out of my house at the top of my lungs. (Repressed feelings much) Things got quiet fast and in that space, I snatched my shit back so fast that I accidentally dropped the moissy and it bounced or got kicked out of sight. Cue my inappropriate, fed up laughter. I couldn\u2019t hold it in. \n\nHubs and FIL got everyone out after that and as of now, they are banned from the house. I\u2019m cutting them all off with no remorse. As of yet, no one has called me personally but word is that the Grand Dame is livid (I still don\u2019t know why she\u2019s so vehement about all of this tbh) while BIL and SIL are thinking about getting tattoos vs rings. I have no comment. Hubs feels like he\u2019s at fault for everything but I\u2019ve explained there\u2019s no way I blame him for his family\u2019s actions. He thought I was too nice to offer anything. FIL and I are linking up to discuss Reddit as he\u2019s amazed by the platform so hey, something good came from this. \n\nWe have looked for the stone and so far we have no fucking idea where it is. Confession time: it\u2019s slightly satisfying that we can\u2019t locate it. Where is Sister Unella when you need her?\n\n*For those concerned, I do not keep loads of loose gems and jewelry in our home. I have my jewelry that stays in a hidden safe when I\u2019m not wearing it and raw gems and crystals of little value decoration my spaces like the little witch I am. Heirloom items and other things stay locked in safety deposit boxes left over from my parents. We have proper security measures in place after a break in a few years ago so I apologize if I seemed nonchalant about that subject.", "I dont know if it\u2019s a regional thing, but random people selling tamales is pretty normal here. \n \nThere is one lady who sits at Walmart in a van with her family and she legit sells the best tamales. Like my abuela\u2019s tamales are obviously the best in the word but second to that is this lady\u2019s tamales. They\u2019re fucking bomb. \n \nAnyways, my work was having a potluck. I thought I\u2019d sprinkle some flavor into the sea of velveeta sauce. I called the lady and ordered 36 tamales, and brought them.  \n \nDisclaimer: obviously this lady doesn\u2019t have a food license or anything, but it\u2019s a potluck. No one making food to bring in did either. I\u2019ve had these tamales a million times and never gotten hurt. \n \nWell, after everyone basically inhaled the tamales they started asking how I made them etc. I explained how tamales are usually made but said I got them from van lady. Some people seemed fine with it but others were visibly upset it wasn\u2019t cooked by me or from a restaurant. \n \nMy boss asked to talk to me on Monday morning.... \n \nAITA?", "UPDATE: I have no amount of thanks worthy to the comment that suggested homeowners insurance. After calling, it looks like they are willing to cover half of the amount. As for the BS ambulance charge, my boyfriend called the hospital and tore them to shreds over it, and it has now been removed. He's also filed a formal complaint against them. As for the remaining 600 euros, his mother actually offered to split it with me, and sincerely apologized for the poisoning and how she acted. This was actually a huge step forward for her, so my bf also offered to pitch in. So yeah. The incident is now over with and we're all moving on and going for dinner somewhere today. Surprisingly happy ending. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I were out visiting his mother at her country house. His brother and sister-in-law, and his sister were also there. The farm has loads of fruit/veggies/berries/herbs/etc growing, and a lot of it is natural, so one evening, his mother decided to make a berry pie. She's cooking the berry mixture, and my boyfriend and I notice it smells strange when we walk into the kitchen. We comment on it, and his mum gets all huffy, saying she's lived out here for ages and knows what to pick.\n\nObviously she doesn't because about 30-45mins after we eat it, we're all being rushed to the hospital, vomiting and feverish. His mother and sister go in an ambulance, and my boyfriend, myself and his brother and sister-in-law have a neighbour drive us. Because this isn't my home country, I have private insurance while I'm waiting on approval for permanent residency ( bf+his fam have free, national health care). The insurance company I use prefers it if we call to clear our issue before going to the hospital (provided we're able to). I call and explain the situation, and the guy I talk to gives me the all clear to go to the hospital and get treatment.\n\nA couple weeks later, I get a bill from the hospital for 700euros and a letter from the hospital informing me that my insurance won't cover it because the situation was \"preventable\". They even charged me for the ambulance that I didn't use. I call my insurance company, stating the guy I called before I went to the hospital said I was cleared, and they give me some BS answer about that decision not being binding, and that after reviewing the instance I'm not eligible, blah blah. I then call the hospital and try to argue the ambulance charge, but they stand firm claiming that the ambulance was for the group.\n\nI talk to my parents about this, and they think my boyfriend's mum should pay because it was her mistake, and she paid everyone else's hospital fee (about 20euros each). I feel a bit awkward asking, but after some deliberation I send her a message asking her to pay it (minus the cost of the medications and ambulance (was a sh\\*t charge but I don't feel it's fair to ask her to pay that)). So I'm asking for roughly 500euros.\n\nShe takes this as a super personal attack, and both my boyfriend's siblings think I'm being unreasonable and causing her unnecessary stress. She says it was an accident, and she shouldn't have to pay for it because it was just a mistake. I understand that it was a mistake, but it was avoidable if she paid attention to what berries she was picking. My boyfriend is trying to stay out of it, as it's just been over the last year where he's patched up his relationship with his mother, so he doesn't want to damage it (which I 100% understand). He thinks neither of us are wrong, but isn't sure who's right.\n\nAITA for asking her to pay, since it was her mistake?", "During the moving process of finding an apartment, my roommate's parents were single-handedly the most difficult people to deal with. The following events all took place in chronological order. \n\n\n\n\n- I originally wanted to move in April in order to avoid having to move during finals. His parents shot down the idea and told him that he was not allowed to sign the lease until May. \n\n\n- We prepared a complete list of furniture together without our parents' involvement. (Keep in mind that we are both 19. My parents who live abroad simply gave me a budget and told me to sort it out myself). My roommate's parents vetoed the list of furniture and told us that everything had to be cheaper. Ok no worries, I proceed to sit on my own and recreate an entire list of furniture and then send it again. For a second time, It was rejected because the \u201ccouch was too expensive for no reason\u201d (Keep in mind this couch is being bought used)\n\n\n- Sensing an approach to the move in date and the fact that I still was not given the ok to buy the furniture. I tell my roommate that I need to buy the furniture because he is leaving for summer and I do not want to be stuck building it all on my own. For an entire week, my roommate then avoids me completely telling me that he has finals and not to bother him.\n\n\n- His parents refuse to allow me to purchase the furniture and tell me to wait. (It is now May 1st, I have the keys to the apartment and no furniture I managed to convince my dorm to allow me to stay a couple of extra days)\n\n\n- Since the delivery date of the furniture would now be after he leaves I asked him if his parents would be willing to split the assembly fee so that I would not have to build everything on my own. His parents said no. They would not pay for someone to come assemble the furniture because it would be an extra 100$.\n\n\n- May 3rd I receive a call from my dad. My dad has always been more of the strict type, he berated me on the phone for not having been organized enough to sort out buying furniture for an apartment as a 19-year-old. I was told to just buy whatever furniture I want out of my pocket rather than wait on my roommate to respond. My mom had also forced my dad to buy a plane ticket to fly 18 hours to come to assist me in moving. \n\n\n- After my dad flew 18 hours to come to assist me and my roommate in moving and building all of the furniture my roommate told me that his parents were coming to our city for the summer and that they wanted to stay in the apartment for a month and a half. He wanted them to sleep in my room.\n\n\n\nAfter my roommate left I hired a carpenter and installed a key lock on the door of my bedroom. Since I paid for the TV, Couch, and pretty much 60% of all the furniture my dad wanted me to put the couch and tv in storage. \n\n\n\nI decided that the best medium would be to leave everything but to lock my bedroom door. My mother warned me that if I go through with this I could potentially lose my best friend. WIBTA if I locked my door for the summer?", "Background on this: I have never seen eye to eye with my mother in law. MIL also has a boyfriend who I don't care for either. \n\nIt has been her dream to take my kids on a Disney Cruise ever since they were born. We have had massive issues with her not caring about their safety (most egregious example, she let my daughter ride on the dashboard--yes the dashboard--of her car on the highway going 80mph. Her excuse was \"she had so much fun! I couldn't help it!). So I told her that if we could all go then maybe I would I consider it. \n\nHer boyfriends mom died last year and he got like a small $30000 inheritance and she talked him into spending it all on a Disney cruise for the entire family (two of them, husband and I, two kids). I am going because everyone is excited but I am dreading every single minute of it. I don't really like cruises, Disney is not my thing and we are going to be away from our business for about two weeks so getting back is going to be a nightmare. \n\nI was packing up last night and my now 8 year old came up to me and said \"Grandma said we are going to push you over the railing on day one so the rest of us can have some fun.\" I was like whoa. I asked her what else she said and it was something like \"when your drowning she's going to hook Daddy up with a huge black lady who isn't such a snit about bad food.\"\n\nI immediately went to my husband and told him I was cancelling the trip. She has said things like this to my kids before so while it may not be an exact retelling, I know Bella didn't make this up. My husband is begging me not to cancel because he really needs the break from work. I told him fine, we'll take a two week camping trip or go to the beach but for me being around his mom will be worse than work--let alone she made a joke about murdering me. \n\nKids are despondent that we might not go and now guilt is getting to me. would I be the asshole if I cancel this trip?\n\nEdit (I guess 4 hours since OP): Thank you for all the advice, from you guys this is my plan of action:\n\n1. I (and we) are going on the cruise. \n\n2. I\u2019m going to far more fun than she ever could be, moms going to ride ATVs and do the rock wall. Her plan is just to stuff them with cake and candy. \n\n3. I\u2019m going to talk with whoever I need to to ensure that my husband and I are the only ones who can kids out of activities. \n\n4. I\u2019m going to thank her boyfriend profusely for paying for the trip. \n\nedit: I forgot the most important part, my husband is on his way over to her house to talk to her in person that what she said is not ok and go over the rules for the trip. She's going to have a meltdown but it's what she got by acting like a complete ass. \n\nAnything I\u2019m missing?\n\nEdit3: lots of you asking what happened after my husband talked with her last night, this is a C&P from a reply I made:\n\n>She just head nodded him and cried last night doing her typical \"whoa is me, I never meant anything by it I was just being funny\" like she always does. She's in for a real surprise when we get on the ship and her plans to have the kids sleep in her room and feed them awful food isn't going to happen. If it's allowed I'll certainly update when we get back.", "I pay $85 a month for this spot in my apartment complex, and the garage is gated off so random cars shouldn\u2019t usually get in.

He then insisted he was joking, and how he had never met anyone as easily offended as me.\n\nThis brings us to last night. We were at a friends house, surrounded by people, when an acquaintance asked what I was doing with my time, since I\u2019m unable to work for the time being. As I was about to answer, my boyfriend jutted in and said, \u201cbeing a waste of space\u201d. \n\nWhen I told him later that I was upset by that, he insisted that he was joking, and I shouldn\u2019t be so sensitive.\n\nThe truth is, I feel really shitty for being mad at him and upset after all he\u2019s doing to help me out. He had to help me shower the first few days, has helped me with cooking, and has taken me to five doctors appointments this week, not including the night he spent with me in the ER.\n\nSo tell me, am I being an ungrateful asshole for harboring anger toward him? \n\nUPDATE- Thanks for all of your responses. To address a few questions: it isn\u2019t just the arm that is broken, but the elbow, so it really limits the things I can do by myself, as mobility is extremely limited. I understand that this certainly puts him in a stressful position, and one he has never been in before. It\u2019s a learning experience for both of us, and we are both definitely in a tough position. Regarding why I don\u2019t work- I would rather not give details for anonymity\u2019s sake, but due to my line of work I am absolutely unable to work until my injury is healed. I don\u2019t think my boyfriend is a bad person, although maybe a bit immature, and not great under this kind of pressure. Thanks again, everyone. \n\nUPDATE 2- For all asking, yes I am on painkillers which may have hormonal side effects. As to the tossing of the shorts and tissue, my reaction very well may have been due to that, and also because wincing away hurt the stitches in my face, and I was afraid of something hitting it. ", "My stepson is a constant quitter. He wants to do everything until he realizes it takes effort..Today I was studying while he played the Xbox. He was playing the retro sonic game we got him for Christmas. When he plays as long as the game doesn\u2019t require any effort he is cool. The moment there is a trick or something to figure out he goes and grabs his mom. So he is playing the game and this wall comes up. The trick is to grab a power up and blast through. He doesn\u2019t realize it so he runs at the wall for 5 minutes. He doesn\u2019t try to figure it out at all. So he goes to grab his mom. This time I called BS and told him to come back and finish the game. He said he was done and I said no you need to figure this out because I\u2019m tired of watching you quit. He starts to argue and I cut him off. Eventually he finishes the part. I\u2019m not trying to make him think that video games are a chore but I\u2019m also not trying to raise someone who half asses everything.\n\nTLDR my stepson try\u2019s to quit all the time so I made home finish a level.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\n I stopped trying to argue because people are going to have their opinions. I love my son and I will raise him to the best of my ability to be a man. You say it\u2019s just a game well guess what? it\u2019s not just the game, it\u2019s the schoolwork I have coached him through because he was failing, it\u2019s the chores I had to get him to try, it\u2019s every bottle I have ever opened because he didn\u2019t feel like trying. I didn\u2019t \u201cForce it down his throat\u201d I taught him that if he actually applies himself he doesn\u2019t have to back down from any challenge. To the people who said he is just seven, I now understand where immature, lazy, and shitty adults come from. Parents like you who don\u2019t recognizing that parenting isn\u2019t just about having fun. It is about grooming and preparing them for life.  The most important thing I ever learned is at the end of the day the only person you can truly count on is yourself eventually one day or another you will have to stand on your own two feet.", "Happened Dec. 2018, been thinking about the situation on-and-off since then.\n\nI\u2019m 23 (F) and my parents have me keep my phone\u2019s location on at all times, even though I\u2019m a graduate student and live away from home. \n\nI was with my boyfriend (23) for the day. My phone ended up at 5% before dinner, so I asked to charge it in his car. I knew that some cars can\u2019t charge phones if the engine isn\u2019t on, but bf said it\u2019d work on his. I had also read online that putting your phone on airplane mode helps it to charge faster. It turned off my location, which I didn\u2019t know about. I plugged my phone into the car charger, checked to see that it\u2019s working, then went into the restaurant. I even used my bf\u2019s phone to text my mom and let her know that my phone was charging in the car and that she could text my bf to contact me. I make it home by my curfew, and head to my room. A few minutes later, my mom immediately texts me, and the following conversation happens. I don\u2019t remember the exact words, but here\u2019s the general gist.\n\nMom: where were you?\n\nMe: what do you mean?\n\nMom: your location was off. \n\nMe: I didn\u2019t realize, I turned on airplane mode to charge my phone faster. \n\nMom: you can\u2019t charge your phone when the car isn\u2019t on. \n\nMe: I thought that too, so I checked with [bf], it works on his car.\n\nMom: I\u2019m going to try charging my iPad in the car without turning on the engine. \n\nMe: your car is a different model than his, it might not work.\n\nMom: it doesn\u2019t work, I tried on all 3 cars\n\nMe: like I said, his car is a different model\n\nMom: what car does he drive? \n\nMe: *gives make and model of car* why are you interrogating me?\n\nMom: maybe if you used some better excuse. \n\nAt this point, I felt hurt. I said that there was no reason for her to be questioning me like this, especially after I had already explained to her what had happened. I said it was really hurtful that she would accuse me of lying or \u201cmaking excuses\u201d when I went out of my way to keep her updated. She ignored what I said and even went on to say \u201cnext time he\u2019s here, I\u2019m going to try charging my phone in his car when the engine is off, to show that you\u2019re lying.\u201d \n\nI was really upset my mom didn\u2019t seem to trust me. I told her that until she was ready to apologize and treat me like an adult instead of a criminal, I didn\u2019t want to talk to her. The next morning, when she tried talking to me, I ignored her. When my dad finally asked if we got into an argument, my mom said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. She\u2019s mental.\u201d My frustration boiled over after hearing her dismiss my feelings in such a demeaning way. I ended up crying and tried to explain what had really happened to my dad. I barely got two sentences out when he cut me off and told me to apologize to my mom. When I refused, he said that I was ungrateful.\n\nAITA?", "I love my wife but she is awful to travel with. She's a bit of a princess and she doesn't care about art or architecture. She wears stupid shoes and walks too slow, but gets tired of places too fast.\n\nI did originally have a meeting in London but it got cancelled and I still wanted to go, so I booked myself into a fancy hotel, went to galleries, rode the subway and ate in amazing restaurants for three nights. Aw man it was awesome. I just enjoyed not caring about her being entertained and being alone to my thoughts.\n\nI just kept thinking the whole time I was there how she wouldn't have liked it, and would have ruined it. If I'd have told her about it she would have come with me, no question. \n\nAm I an asshole?", "I'm from New Zealand and i live in Ireland at the moment. One of my friends, Kathy, is Irish and had been dating another kiwi named John. John claimed to be a member of the New Zealand Royal navy. I knew he was a phony from the beginning, since i am a member myself i noticed him wearing the uniform incorrectly on social media and when i met him at a party he told me stuff that didn't make sense such as serving in units that would've been impossible with his occupation and time he claimed to have enlisted etc. I have told Kathy and her friends my concerns but they never believed me because he had photos of him with groups of other navy guys on ships. Im guessing either photoshop or maybe he had a bunch of other phonies dress up on a ship or something idk. \n\nI was able to get someone i knew in the service to search up his name and i found that he actually enlisted but was dishonorably discharged within a week of entering for bad conduct. Obviously this means he is not a lieutenant and should not have any uniforms. I get this information within a few weeks before his wedding. There's several legal ways to do this but i don't want to get into it for confidentiality.\n\n  Kathy's brother emailed around 1600 making announcements for the wedding. This allowed me to get everyone's emails. I sent an email explaining all the discrepancies of his uniforms, stories he told, and finally proof submitting his discharge papers. Kathy decided to cancel the wedding and there was massive flame war that occurred, via email. I didn't even know that was possible but it happened. People went on saying how was a scumbag that should've minded my own business. Other people have told me that i should've told Kathy this privately but i feel everyone should've known that this man was a lying piece of shit. Kathy was initially angry but has now thanked me. I have gotten angry hate mail from John's family but I've ignored it \n\nTe Taua Moana o Aotearoa, (\"Warriors of the Sea of New Zealand\")", "Long story short, I work with a really ignorant man.

He talked about my dick for about 5 hours. I figured if it was on his mind that much he wanted to see it. I sent him one of my favorite ones that I send my wife all the time.\n\nHe was not amused and he called me an asshole.

Unless somebody's behavior is risking a personal injury. \n\nSome people suck, but even shity people have families to feed.", "My mother-in-law has a terrible habit of interrupting and talking over people. For example, when she was driving to our house she got lost, despite having a GPS so she called for help. Every time we tried to give her directions she would talk over us, complaining loudly about technology, other drivers, how tired she was, etc. She spent so much time talking over us, she ended up missing several turns and it took me repeating \"I can't help you if you won't listen\" several times before she stopped talking long enough to get instructions.\n\nMy son (11) has been frustrated with her tendency to talk over him. He has ADHD and struggles to get sentences out and when he gets interrupted it is hard for him to pick up what he was saying. However, he wants to be heard just like anyone else.\n\nHe used to just go silent when she would talk over him, but he got annoyed enough that he started asserting himself. Now when she does it he says \"Please stop interrupting me.\" and \"I was still talking, please let me finish.\"\n\nHe does say please, and he doesn't raise his voice, but he definitely has an angry tone when he says it. Every time he does this she huffs and looks at me like \"you need to do something.\"\n\nMy knee-jerk response is to scold him for using that tone with his grandmother, but at the same time, I think he's justified in demanding a little courtesy. I haven't scolded him.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Based on the advice here I had a talk with my son. I told him I was proud of him for standing up for himself and that it is ok for him to ask to not be interrupted. I also said that it is possible to be kind and firm at the same time, and as long as he continued to use polite words and tried to use a kinder tone I would support him.\n\nI didn't put it in my original post, but when she was interrupting him, it wasn't when he was trying to talk to her. We were in a car and he was trying to tell me something and she kept talking over him to say something unrelated. So, I also had a conversation with my MIL when my son was not around. I explained how his ADHD makes it harder for him to pick up the thread of a thought than it is for other people and that I want to hear what he has to say since he already has such a hard time expressing himself.\n\nShe responded by saying that he shouldn't interrupt an adult and he needs to learn to be more respectful. It's the same litany that was hammered into my head when I was a kid, hence my knee-jerk instinct to scold. But, despite my indoctrination I actually think that everyone should be treated with consideration, regardless of age. I said as much to her. It did not go over well.\n\nIt's probably a good thing she lives out of state and will be going home soon.", "So i have a baby on the way who is due to arrive any day now. The topic of piercing her ears has came up a couple times but this last conversation i really put my foot down. My girlfriend wants to pierce my newborns ears but i refuse to allow her to do it. I feel like it is a completely unneccessary thing to do. The only reason ANYONE i have asked can give me, is because it \"looks pretty\"  No. My daughter is not an accessory for you to decorate. Why put her through that pain with no say whatsoever, my girlfriend is trying to say it only hurts for a second but i dont believe that. There has to be soreness after that the baby is just incapable of communicating. I just dont feel comfortable with stabbing a needle through my child's ears for \"beauty\". She tries to argue that women go through pain all the time for beauty, but that is by choice and is exactly what is wrong with the beauty industry in my opinion. It got to the point where i said absolutley not and she is threatening to do it behind my back. I said that if she does so, then we will have serious relationship issues to deal with. Am i over reacting?\n.\n.\n .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n**UPDATE \nI thought i would answer some common questions coming in. \n\n1) yes my s/o is hispanic, but i know for a fact it is just a beauty thing and not a cultural one. Not saying she is ashamed of her culture, but she has never been overly proud or traditional..if that makes sense.\n\n2) yes we have discussed circumcision and both agreed it was an outdated, horrible practice and would not do it if we had a son. Though she states it is vastly different than piercing ears.\n\n3) no our relationship is not shit lol. We have been having an amazing time planning and setting up our nursery. We are both as excited as can be and as happy as ever. \n\n4) i would not call this an arguement, more so a debate in which i strongly stated my stance and refuse to budge. But at the end of the day i understand that she is the mother and is going to have the final say on 95 percent of these issues, having said that, i am going to stand my ground on this specific issue. \n\n5) i have had my own ears pierced in the past but it was with a gauged needle so the pain factor is really incomparable. Mine obviously being very much more painful. I do remember the soreness lasting quite some time though.\n\n6) also to clarify, i stated our relationship would have issues if she deliberately went behind my back amd pierced her ears, it would make me feel as if i had no say in our child's life.\n.........................................................................................\n***Update #2***\nSo i am about to drop a bomb shell on you guys, i am Hispanic myself, so this is not a case of me not respecting her culture or traditions.  I am just hoping to raise my daughter as a strong woman who understands that her consent is always important and required when it comes to her body. You have to think there is some form of subconscious thought process developed having your parents put you through pain for nothing more than personal gain.  I want her to know that we do stop and consider her feelings when making decisions for her...i know, crazy right?", "So two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\n\nedit: this blew up like crazy. I had no idea, thank you I think pretty much everyone so far thinks at least my initial reaction is ok. \n\nThe thing that people seem most confused by is the timeline and honestly I was wrong in my OP. Tam and I only talked for maybe 10 minutes on Friday evening so there is a lot I don't know but I went through my texts and such and this is the best I can put together.\n\nJune 2017--Gregory took me to Hawaii, that is the last time I saw him. We texted maybe two three times a week. \n\nMay 2018--Tammy gets her job and moves to new city. We text or call easily a combined 100 times a day or more. \n\nlate July 2018-- Tammy confesses that she's really lonely, all her coworkers are older and she's seriously thinking about quitting and moving back. I tell her she should call Greg, she doesn't have his number so I give it to her. I still keep getting \"flirty\" but nothing overt from Gregory in this time period\n\n\nAugust 2018-- I start a project at my job (promotions company) setting up for a December event for a A/B list celebrity. It's literally make or break for my company and my career. I work 16 hour day minimums and basically go off the grid. Greg still texts occasionally and I keep missing Tammy's calls. \n\nSeptember 2018--last text from Greg, like I said no big deal. I didn't even see this until today but Tammy texted me \"please call me ASAP, we really need to talk about something.\" This adds a whole new element to the story but I can't believe I forgot or missed the text. I respond to another text of her's later in the day kindy of bitchy \"hey you know I'm busy...give me some time to breathe.\" Another piece I forgot until I dug in my texts. She may have taken this as a message I wasn't ready. \nI assume this is when they first hooked up. \n\n\nSeptember to December: we still miss each other and honestly don't think I talked to her and looking back she texted about 5 times to every one of my responses and if I read it right, she initiated all conversations. I wasn't a very good friend. My event goes off pretty well and then I immediately leave for an overseas vacation with my family. \n\n\nJanuary. We still didn't talk at all but I didn't think much of it. \n\n\nFriday the 1st. She drops the news in person she's been pregnant for about two weeks and getting married in April. \n\n\nSo that's the timeline, not sure if it clears anything but it looks like Tam may have reached out to me at least once. \n", "My wife is 12 weeks pregnant and is having a really rough time with morning sickness. She'll typically throw up about 7-10 times a day despite being on the same medication they give chemo patients. To give some context; this pregnancy is her second - the first pregnancy was slightly better in terms of sickness (only 4-7 spews a day!) but it lasted pretty much the full 9 months.\n\nShe is an actual trooper and I'll forever be thankful for what she goes through to bring our beautiful children in to this world. I've made a point of taking up extra slack, doing more chores around the house, more cooking and taking on additional childcare duties to give her a much needed break.\n\nUnfortunately for me, she has a terrible vomiting technique. When she has the need, she'll stand over the toilet, bend over ever so slightly and hit the eject button. The angle she bends down at can conveniently be demonstrated by a rough ASCII diagram:\n\n       \u00b4\u0f40`\n      /   \n     /    |\n    |   __|\n    |  |  |\n    |  |__|\n\nWith most of the spews being projectile, needless to say, we end up with an extremely messy toilet area. There is vomit everywhere. On the seat. Under the seat. On the floor around the toilet. The toilet she uses most of the time during the day is located in a small room, about 1.5 meters wide with the toilet in the center. As I type this, both walls on either side are showered in remnants of one particularly violent session. I do not understand the physics of this; all I know is that I am disgusted.\n\nI asked her to clean up after herself but she is resistant. She has always been quite lazy when it comes to cleaning up and is an untidy person; generally happy to live in what I deem to be pretty dirty conditions. From my perspective, this is next level filth and is unacceptable despite her current condition, particularly because it could be resolved with an improved technique.\n\nShe says that she doesn't want to get closer to the toilet because it's gross, made more unpleasant because she has to do it so frequently throughout the day. Her position is that cleaning the toilet for her is the least I could do considering she is likely going to have to do this for the next 6 months.\n\nReddit, you will determine who cleans our toilets post-spews for the next 6 months. The stakes are high. Do not hesitate. Every seconds counts.", " Context, I'm 28 and my sister is 17. Our parents are junkies that neglected us and I moved out as soon as I can & have a house now. Well apparently an incident happened and they lost custody of my sister, and she was either to be sent to a foster home or sent to live with me considering I'm the only one fit for it. I took her in and not much trouble has occurred since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Except yesterday I was trying to fall asleep when I heard faint moaning noises and they were coming from downstairs. I went to investigate and turns out she was having sex with her boyfriend. I sprinted upstairs and pretended I didn't see anything. Today I sat her down, explain that it's my home and I do not want her to have sex in it, ESPECIALLY when I'm inside too. That's apart from letting a stranger into my house without telling me. She got mad and said that I wasn't her parent and have no right to tell her what to do and when I said it's my house she said it's \"our\" house now. Okay sure it's our house but it's in my name and until she turns 18 she should abide my rules. She locked herself in her room after I said that and here we are. AITA?", "I really need to know if I'm in the wrong here so the advice is appreciated. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've always been the resident chef for my family. My wife is an awful cook (her words, not mine) so over the years I've been the one to cook every meal for my family. I've spent a lot of time learning too. I've taken multiple classes each year to help me and honestly it's slowly became a passion of mine. So, for most of the night for the past 16 years i've come home and spent at least an hour, often several making diner for my family. \n\nThis is where my daughter comes in, lets call her sally. Sally turned 16 this year and oh boy has it been rough. She never left her rebellious phase. She has always tried to make me and her mom know how much she hates us and that she can't wait till she's in the \"real world\" so she can finally be free. I get it. She's at that age where she wants more freedom and sometimes we can be hard on her. That's not the problem here. \n\nOne of sally's new things though is telling me how much my cooking sucks. For the past two weeks every night i've cooked she will tell me everything wrong with the meal i've cooked. She will go on all night about the \"crap\" I forced her to eat and that she should just be able to cook her own meal instead. She's far past the age of letting her go hungry so I just have let it go, until last night. I got off work late so I just decided to grab burgers on the way home for diner. Sally went on and on after about how she \"finally had decent food to eat\" and that \"this stuff wasn't cooked by a pathetic wannabe chef\". I don't know why but that hit me hard and I ended up crying in my room after. My wife caught me and told me it needs to stop now. \n\nSo tonight when I got home I cooked enough for me, my wife, and my son. I steamed some rice and beans and put them on a plate for my daughter. When she came to eat I informed her since I only cook \"crap\" i made her something else and that was all she would be eating in this house from now on. She blew up. She called me an ass and a bad father before storming to her room. My son things I'm just being mean and that i've sunk to her level while my wife says I did the right thing. I talked to my mom too and she says this was a heavy over reaction and that all teens do this at some point and that I only will make things worse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "Ages are all late 20s early 30s.\n\nA few weeks ago my friend came over to try on some clothes. My husband came home and walked in on her changing, seeing her nearly naked. It was embarrassing and awkward, but we all got over it with some nervous laughter. Or so i thought.\n\nMy husband will not drop it. Constantly making comments about it to me, and to them whenever we get together.  So I invite them over to clear the air and for my husband to apologize. He does and we have drinks and play some games. My friends husband was winning and makes a comment about it, and my husband brings it up again! But this time it felt like it was to be hurtful. \n\nWe've all had enough of it, and I certainly have too. So I whipped off my top and bra and say \"Now everyone's seen my tits so you can finally DROP IT!\". \n\nThat was this weekend and hes been pretty upset, but I don't think he realized how upset he has been making everyone else feel. I'm starting to think I went too far but I also think I had to do something.\n\nI left out a lot of details but that's the gist of it. So am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: It was pointed out I should add some info. We have talked about it, many times. Little fights and big ones. He just says stuff like \"oh i'm just joking\". He has made comments to me in private about it, and in front of the other couple. He thinks hes just being funny or something i'm not really sure. He's always been a bit crass but never insulting like this. We're doing okay, we are both upset and both realizing we messed up and I'm going to suggest we see councilor to mend this up.\n\nAnd I don't think they were really offended about seeing me, probably more mortified about the blow up.\n\nEdit 2: okay so... This has got to a point where I can't really reply to each comment. And maybe I should have posted this in r/relationship_advice? \n\nWell anyways here's a little more info. \n\nTo the people saying I \"forced them to see my boobs without their consent\". I've known her almost half my life and feel I know her husband well enough to have a pretty good gauge on how they would feel about it. And you can see boobs out in public in some places, I didn't masterbate infront of them, Jesus. \n\nThis isn't the end of our relationship or friendship. Yeah we're both pissed at eachother, but some of you are making it wayy more worse than it sounds. I've been talking to my friend and we just want everything to be water under the bridge. \n\nI definitely come to the conclusion with a lot of your comments that there's something more here going on that we will be talking about. \n\nI know it's hard not to judge a person based on this post, but it's only been the smallest portion of our relationship. This is out of character for him. The best way I can describe his normal behavior is like the brother in law Hank from breaking bad. He can be a ball buster but he obviously took it too far this time. \n\nI'm not going to post my tits. \n\nI'm going to talk to him tonight and I'll make a final edit. \n\nI don't really know what the verdict here is, but yeah two wrongs don't make a right. I don't normally do this sort of thing and I was embarrassed the next morning. A lot of people called us immature, and yeah I'll have to accept that as the whole thing was pretty childish.\n\nFinal Edit: Well is not as insightful as I was hoping, but we did talk tonight. We both apologized to each other (again) and he's going to apologize to them. He knows he took it too far and acted childish and regrets it. I showed him the post and we read a few of the comments, some of which were really helpful and we both felt pretty embarrassed. As to why he was so obsessed, he really didn't have an answer. I asked if he had a crush on my friend, if he thought I didn't look good anymore, if he was jealous or resented them. He said no to all, but admitted he may be a little jealous (i guess). But we didn't go too far into it. When i brought up counseling he pushed the idea saying we didn't need it. I told him don't think of it like therapy more as getting out your thoughts with a mediator present and he eventually agreed ( we did pre-marriage counseling before). I think we are okay, not perfect but okay and the counseling will help.", "So we are four 20 year old girls in our first college apartment. As such we are all broke college students and I do not have the extra money to constantly front them for everything. The wireless bill is on my card, the groceries go on my card and literally everything else. One of them still owes me $50 from last weeks grocery trip. The wireless bill is $80 for the first month and $49.99 every month after that. It is only $20, and they will not pay (but they have bought several packs of juul pods since we have moved in). So now we are here where I have texted them saying \"so i am getting pretty sick of constantly chasing people for money so when you pay your part of the bill you can have the password. Sorry but i am at my wits end here\". Please note this after asking for it once and gently reminding them twice because these are my friends and I don't want to end our friendship over wifi issues but am I being an asshole here?\n\nEdit \\~ it has been two hours since i texted them and they have not responded but instead left so i am unsure where this is going. It is only two of my roommates that will not pay, thankfully one of my friends is responsible.\n\n2nd Edit \\~ For those interested they have finally responded to my text (4hrs later) with a \"how tf were we supposed to know how much the bill was\"  and they want to have an apartment sit down so I guess they want to turn this into a huge issue and this friendship may not be salvageable. Also they still have not paid.\n\n3rd Edit \\~ So roommate C was the one who asked to have a apartment meeting later but instead she texted this in our group chat \" if you don\u2019t see how what you did today was screwed up then that\u2019s your first issue. i wanted to be civil ab this but you changed the password before letting us know the amounts due. i would rather iron this out now compared to later in the year when we have due dates/homework and suddenly won\u2019t be able to connect because someone\u2019s in a bad mood. if we\u2019re expected to pay for anything then just ask us to pay, we always do. It\u2019s ridiculous being pushed around and wanting us to beg you to share the new passwords whenever you change them.we all invested 25% in the apartment and wifi so we\u2019re all paying for exactly that. we all have the same amount of say in what happens here. if you gave us a monthly date you want the $20 or whatever it is for wifi then you\u2019ll have your money on that date. it doesn\u2019t have to be an issue if you don\u2019t make it one, but if we\u2019re living in sydney\u2019s house with sydney's wifi and sydney's food then i\u2019ll just get my own shit and you can pay 100% for you instead of a four way split\" \\*\\*copied and pasted this text message as is\\*\\*\n\nso just to be clear they never pay when asked, technically roommate C still owes me $15 from last year but I obviously have moved past that. They have never paid or helped setting up the wireless so I am unsure what that is about but from this I think its becoming more and more clear that they are not true friends.\n\n4th Edit \\~ The two would like to do all groceries individually  which is absolutely fine with me #byesister\n\n5th Edit \\~ Roommie C and I had a talk and she said if i couldn't understand that what I did was fucked up then I am just a shitty person. She then said I have ruined our friendship over $20. So i guess this did not have a happy ending\n\nRoommie 1 is on my side, Roomie 2 agrees we were all confused lets move but Roommie 3 aka Roommie C will not just let us all except some blame and move on \\*\\* if anything else happens i will let you know\n\n6th Edit \\~ Roommate C has informed me her overdraft fee will be billed to me so I told her to leave me the hell alone, venmoed her, her money back, and she tells me she doesn't want my money now. Roommate C is clearly a psycho, it makes much more sense now why she attracts such insane men.\n\nClarification Edit ~ I said we all made mistakes here because sometimes you just need to swallow your pride to preserve a friendship. It is only $20 but its also about the principle. I am supposed to be your friend to please have some respect for my finances as well. \n\nI told them more than once when the bill was due. They were well aware. Roommate 2 and I both just decided to move on and not dwell because I never went into this with the intention of seriously pissing them off. I literally just need to grab their attention. \n\nRoommate 2 and I talked that out. Roommate 3/C refused to accept her part in the responsibility of paying on time. She refuses to take even still fully pay. \n\nThey both do have access to the wireless. I am not a bitch. I legitimately just thought if they realized my joke was serious (about no money no wifi) they would just immediately be like oops here is $20. I never thought Roommate C would blow this up. That is the main reason I even wondered if I was the asshole because of her reaction.\n\nFinal Edit ~ Roomie C and I have a class together on tuesday/thursdays at 2:30 so I was kinda freaking out worried about if she would still sit in our spot or just sit somewhere else without speaking to me. But she did sit next to me and was just went about like usual. \n\nAfter the class she said she was sorry for going overboard and that she missed our happy group dynamics. I agreed and said in the future I won\u2019t be so rash and will try to communicate more clearly. At the end of the day our friendship is worth more than the wireless bill. \n\nBut for those who care Roomie C herself agrees I was not the asshole\ud83d\ude02", "Yesterday a kid knocked on my door and asked if I wanted my lawn mowed for $10. I\u2019d mowed fairly recently but admired his entrepreneurial spirit so said sure. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes he comes to my door and says he\u2019s all done. My yard isn\u2019t huge but it usually takes me a solid half hour to mow, more like 45 if I\u2019m really mindful of the edges and corners, so I was a bit suspicious. \n\nI went out to look and it was mowed in haphazard blocky patches, with some large areas totally untouched. I told him he was off to a good start but that I wasn\u2019t satisfied with how he\u2019d only mowed certain parts and I needed a uniform cut. \n\nHe said it looked good to him, so I said it was fine if he didn\u2019t want to finish the job but I\u2019d need my $10 back. \n\nHe started accusing me of taking advantage of him and I said I was happy to pay him if he actually mowed my lawn but if he wasn\u2019t going to do the job I wasn\u2019t going to pay him. \n\nHe said he wouldn\u2019t give me back my $10. I told him I couldn\u2019t force him to return my money but that I\u2019d make a point of warning the whole neighborhood not to use his services. \n\nHe begrudgingly gave back the $10. My husband had to remow the lawn which, like I said, I had just done recently anyways. \n\nA few hours after the kid left his dad showed up and demanded I give the kid the $10 back. I told him I couldn\u2019t pay him for mowing my lawn because he didn\u2019t finish and I would have to mow it just to even everything out and keep it from being an eye sore.\n\nHe railed about how his son was just trying to make honest money over the summer to pay for AirPods and asking me why I would try to discourage him from working. \n\nI offered to give him $5 since he did start the job but the dad refused and badmouthed me to everyone who lives around here. \n\nSeveral people who know me confronted me about it and it was a 50/50 split of people who wanted to let me know he was spreading lies about me stiffing his young son and people who wanted to know why I would be so hard on a kid with good intentions. \n\nI do think it\u2019s great the kid is going out and trying to earn some money. Maybe I should\u2019ve been more clear about my concerns with how he handled the job. \n\nI was dead set that I was in right before, especially after offering $5, but the contestation of some of my friends has gotten me to reconsider since he\u2019s just a kid and maybe had never been shown how to properly mow a lawn. \n\nSo, AITA?", "First and foremost, my son doesn't like me.\n\nNot in a bratty \"I hate you because you didn't let me get McDonalds\" way, but a more subtle way. It's been like this since the beginning. His first word was \"mommy\", and it took him another year to say \"daddy\". When mom comes home from work, it's always \"I missed you so much! How was your day! I saved you some crackers!\", but when I come home from work, my son doesn't bother even coming down from his room to greet me. If I want to know ANYTHING about my sons life outside of home, I have to learn it through my wife. I've tried everything to get him to like me. I took time off of work to spend more time with him, buy him gifts, etc, but he acts like I'm a stepfather trying to force my way into his life. My wife knows how I feel, but aways tells me that I'm reading too much into it, and that he's just a \"mommy's boy\".\n\nI've had to deal with this for 9 years, and it's starting to get to me. It just makes me sad that my own son doesn't love me as much as his mom. I can count on two hands the number of times he's hugged or kissed me, which should say a lot. Two weeks ago, I told my wife I wanted to have another child. She agreed immediately and actually seemed really excited about it, until I said I wanted a child that actually loved me. She did the whole shtick of \"Oh, thats not true, he's just a mommy's boy.\", and laughed it off. I laughed with her, too, but the next day she seemed really distant. She seemed uncomfortable around me and spent the day avoiding me. I think she might be reconsidering having another kid.\n\nI don't resent my wife or my son at all. I just want to have a kid that actually shows affection and love towards me, not one that gives me the cold shoulder and silent treatment for absolutely no reason. AITA for this reason for wanting another child?", "I (26f) moved to the opposite side of the world in 2016. I always had complicated feelings about my family, so not seeing them anymore was a secret bonus, ngl. Have only been home since once and it was very stressful.\n\nI'm trying to hold casual contact with my divorced parents, but am trying to cut out my sisters (29&23) bit by bit because they are too intrusive and opposed to my parents, I don't feel indebted to them one bit.\n\nAnyway, last year my dad turned 50, big party. I transferred some money to my older sister who kind of organised the whole thing with help of my little sister and told me they'll do some sort of shared present with the whole family. I asked what and she said something about a motorbike. I said cool, no more info needed.\n\nFast forward to the party, she calls me at midnight (daytime here, still in bed) via video call and holds my and my partner's unsuspecting, sleepy, half-dressed faces into a room of 60 people who I barely know and hands the phone around.\n\nThen the moment of surprise comes and voila: A money bag designated for a trip to my country lasting three weeks. A trip that conveniently falls right in the middle of my partner's and my 2-months long, already planned out, low-budget road/camping trip at the end of this year. For my dad who's a tad posh and deadly afraid of flying on his own. Without ever so much as mentioning it to me beforehand.\n\nMy partner and I, barely awake from going out the night before, just sat there not knowing what to say. My dad was very thankful and touched.\n\nIn the coming weeks, my dad spent all that money on his gardener. I hoped he'd forget about the original purpose of the money, I offered alternatives, but he insisted on sticking to the plan, I think a little bit due to expectations from everyone and his set time off from work.\n\nSo I replanned our whole trip, much to my partner's and my annoyance because we will basically have to rush through great parts of the trip now. I made sure not to show that to my dad, though, because it's not his fault and he feels easily rejected.\n\nI booked the flights and accommodations. The option of building a structure for the car to sleep in fell through because my dad needs to sit there now. We would have slept in a tent, but now b&b's it is. Anyway, I got over it, everything is booked.\n\nThen I spoke to my older sister (who's idea that whole \"present\" was) and she tells me that she's trying to get a girlfriend for my dad, so he doesn't have to fly alone. Much to my dismay, she was successful. So again, all accommodations cancelled and booked again for 4 people. Great.\n\nSo far I had to pay 5k for everything and my dad keeps putting off paying me the 4k he owes me, so that's that. Bloody gardener. I'm so mad at my sister for putting us into this situation, but everyone just pats her on the shoulder for being such a great fucking person for reuniting my dad and me when I never even wanted it.\n\nAm I the heartless asshole here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all your input, friendly or otherwise! Really didn't expect this much response. I see a lot of assumptions going on here, so I thought I'd provide [some context](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cw1686/aita_for_holding_a_grudge_against_my_sisters_for/ey9gj25?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) for those interested. Hope that helps!", "I am mum to a beautiful 20 year old called Lucy. She has just finished her second year at uni and is at home for the summer. \n\nMy niece Jennifer is getting married in a few weeks time and we have of course been invited. \n\nLucy is a very girly girl type person, loves getting dressed up and trying new clothes so she is very excited. \n\nLucy has got bad vision and has worn glasses from a very early age. She has tried contacts a few times but hates them, both because high prescription contacts are uncomfortable, and also because she feels like she doesn't look like herself without her glasses. \n\nLucy was helping me with some shopping yesterday and in the car ride home we were discussing the wedding, what we were going to wear, what we were doing regarding makeup etc. I made some suggestions to Lucy regarding hair/makeup, but also (maybe thoughtlessly?) suggested she could maybe try contacts. Soon as I said this she gave me a look and was quiet the rest of the car journey. She went upstairs as soon as we got home. \n\nI didn't see her until dinner time, and when I asked what was wrong, she asked why I ''told'' her to wear contacts, and asked if I was ashamed to have a daughter who has to wear ''thick'' glasses. She then took off her glasses and tried to eat her dinner without them. Within a minute or so she was clearly struggling and was close to tears, and asked her dad to get her glasses for her, and she took her food and went to eat upstairs. \n\nMy husband was annoyed with me, asking why I had to suggest contacts to her when I know she doesn't like them. In my defence it was just an impulsive suggestion that came out without even thinking. I have nothing against her glasses and think Lucy is beautiful with or without them. It was just a suggestion to see if she'd like to try a different look.\n\nUPDATE: I had a heart to heart with Lucy earlier today. She broke down crying and admitted that she thinks that I don't like her glasses. That's not true at all and I told her that I only brought up contacts as one of many things she could experiment with for this wedding. I told her how sorry I was for being thoughtless. I know that she's worn glasses for so long that they're a part of her now, and even if they weren't contacts are uncomfortable. I held Lucy while she cried and she made me promise that I would never, ever mention contacts to her again, even at her own wedding, and I swore I wouldn't. I'm the asshole. I was insensitive and spoke without thinking. I knew she didn't like contacts but said the first thing that entered my head. I won't bring up contacts to her again.", "I\u2019m [26F]  currently pregnant for the second time (yay!) I have a daughter, 3F.\n\nFor my baby shower, I decided to include a gender reveal (cheesy, I know) at the end. I had a cake made and the inside of the cake would be pink for a girl or blue for a boy. I thought it was a very cute idea, not over the top like other gender reveals, and my husband thought so too. \n\nI invited about 18 friends and their families, including my own family. So it was a rather large gathering. One of my friends, 26M, is dating a transwoman. They have been together for 8 months and I have met her several times. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re extremely close, though.\n\nAnyways, the baby shower happened on Sunday. It was quite nice and everyone had fun. Then, my husband got the cake out and told everyone that the colour of the filling inside would reveal the gender of the baby. It was a surprise and people were \u201cawwing\u201d and saying how it was so cute. My mother even teared up.\n\nMy husband and I cut the cake. It was blue so that means we\u2019re getting a boy! I was really excited and it was just a great moment.\n\nAt the end, my friend\u2019s trans partner approached me and asked if she could talk with me. Firstly, she thanked me for the party. Then she said that she was surprised by the gender reveal bit at the end, and that she was disheartened by it. She said we seemed like \u201creally forward thinking people\u201d, but that having a gender reveal and calling it that in this day and age is backwards thinking. She said the only thing that it reveals is that my baby has a penis. She said that her parents gendered her to be a boy growing up althought she wanted to be a girl and that it really messed her up. \n\nI defended my actions and said I \u201cdidn\u2019t think too much into it\u201d and said that saying \u201cit\u2019s a boy!\u201d is much better than saying \u201cmy baby has a penis!\u201d especially in front of all my friends and family. \n\nShe said, \u201cWell maybe you can be more open minded when raising your child.\u201d She also told me that if I was planning to do a gender reveal, I should not have invited her because she thinks it was very offensive and almost triggering to go through it. \n\nI thanked her for my input but said at the end of the day, it\u2019s rather rude of her to tell me how the baby shower should have been done or how to raise my son. She seemed upset when she left.\n\nI told my husband afterwards about the interaction and he said I was right for telling her to mind her own business. Plus, he says that it\u2019s not our fault that she was offended by the gender reveal.\n\nAITA?", "A couple years ago I made friends with a guy and a girl who we'll call Sarah and Dan. We grew to be fairly good friends. We're all adults in our mid 20s and when we get together we get really into talking about our relationships.\n\nIt just so happens that Dan is gay, and he liked to actively participate in giving out advice when Sarah and I had relationship issues, and we could do the same for him. But after a while I noticed that he never actually gave me any advice when I had problems with my romantic relationships. When Sarah wanted to talk about her problems he was helpful and gave sound advice, but whenever I was seeking the same, his advice began and ended with \"you should dump your boyfriend and switch to girls.\"\n\nI thought it was a joke the first time but he kept saying it every time I went looking for advice from my friends. He never gave that advice to Sarah when she was having guy problems (even though she's bisexual and that advice would be more applicable to her, although I personally think it's a rude thing to say to anyone). I'm straight, and I have never implied otherwise. I've never even been bi-curious. For me, personally, the idea of myself being with a woman romantically makes me uncomfortable and I told that to Dan several times and asked him to stop. He said he would try. \n\nHe didn't stop.  I started skipping meeting up with Dan and Sarah because his comments continued to make me uncomfortable, but several days ago I decided to meet them for brunch and we started talking romantic relationships. I was supportive as he described a few problems with his current boyfriend and Sarah and I offered a few suggestions to how he could solve those problems; overall it was a good chat.\n\nI'm finally in a committed relationship with a man I adore and I was very excited to share my excitement about it. Along the way I mentioned just a couple pet peeves I had with my boyfriend (that aren't even a big issue) and Dan said it again. \"Well, time for you to dump him and switch to girls!\"\n\nI just snapped. I raised my voice (not quite a yell, but louder than usual) and asked, \"Dan, why don't *you* switch to girls?\"\n\nHe acted like I slapped him. Started crying and demanding to know why I'd ever say something so horrible to him, then he grabbed his stuff and stormed out. Sarah told me how disgusted she was by me and also stormed out. (Side note: that left me to pay the entire bill for brunch when we agreed beforehand we were all only paying for ourselves, so that was awesome /s.)\n\nA few days ago I got a text from Sarah that said she talked to Dan and both of them are disgusted by my behavior and have decided they can't interact with such a \"hateful, homophobic bitch\" anymore and both will be blocking my number and blocking me on all forms of social media.\n\nI still feel pretty justified in what I said but it's started eating at me, especially because it made two different people decide I'm horrible enough to cease contact with altogether. AITA here?", "This last weekend I was home alone with my two boys (ages 4 and 1). My wife (W) was on a trip to China (running a marathon on the Great Wall 'cause she's a beast). Contrary to every sitcom ever, this wasn't too big a deal. W does do the majority of childcare and household chores, but that's just because I work and she currently doesn't. I'm pretty involved with my kids and do plenty of chores when I'm home. Being home alone with them was nothing new.\n\nEarly on the day she was supposed to come home, the boys and I were at church. We ran into my wife's friend (WF, has watched our kids on multiple occasions, seems generally trustworthy, very close with W). She mentions bedsheets W was going to let her borrow and asks if I had brought them. W didn't mention this to me, but I had noticed some sheets that she left next to the front door of our apartment. I was going to lunch after church so I wouldn't be going home to get them for WF, but I made a snap decision that we could probably trust her to grab the sheets on her own. WF was good with this option, so I gave her our door code and went on my merry way.\n\nNow, I had been working through a laundry backlog and little boys are very capable of making a mess, so the house wasn't the most presentable. I had plans to do some more cleanup later that evening. I obviously wasn't expecting to have someone else in the house. Getting two little boys fed and out the door in the morning is a chore all its own anyways. \n\nThings went according to plan and I had the laundry done, dishes cleaned, apartment swept, etc. W came home super tired and thankful that the house looked as good as it did. Wasn't perfect by any stretch, but it rarely is with little boys.\n\nA couple days later, W offhand mentions her friend having come to get the sheets. I tell her what we arranged and find out that the sheets I saw were the wrong ones. WF found them after messaging W, who was surprised she was in our apartment without me. This is where the obnoxious behavior happened. \n\nWF tells W essentially that the house is a mess and I have a lot of work to do to make the apartment presentable before W gets home. I'd be willing to laugh this off as a joke, but WF then proceeds to take a video of our entire apartment to try to \"show how bad it is.\" This lady has no kids so I guess her home is always perfect or something. W is a champ, so she told WF she's not worried about me and even sent WF a message when she got home about how well I did and how clean the house was.\n\nAt any rate, I can't help but feel a little violated and insulted. W and I are equal partners in all we do and the idea that I need to be monitored when W isn't home is just trash IMO. I haven't said or done anything yet, but  WIBTA for confronting her and letting her know she is no longer welcome in our home without supervision, how hurtful that was, etc", "Long time Reddit lurker, just discovered this sub and made an account to post this. \n\nTo keep it brief, I'm a single dad. Idk what I allowed to say here per the rules, but let's just say my kids mum isn't at all a fit mother and I have full custody. I'm pretty young (23, kid is 5) but I really think becoming a parent was the best thing that's happened to me and I wouldn't change a thing. I'm *happy* being a single parent. \n\nMy brother and, especially, his wife don't seem to grasp this. Since I took full custody she's been asking me non-stop when I'm going to \"get back out there\" and trying to set me up with her friends. I've told her multiple times that I'm not interested in dating again right now, and have given her my whole list of reasons as to why. To begin with she countered them with \"oh but you're so young, you should date while you can!!\" type bullshit. Then she started telling me I was selfish and that I'm depriving my kid of a stable two-parent home for my own \"bullshit reasons\". That, I took offence to, because I provide a stable home for my kid by myself and don't need another person to be able to do that.\n\nAnyway, things peaked last month when I found out my sister in law had been signing me up for dating sites and talking to people on my behalf and trying to set up dates. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me, and I kinda flipped out and called my brother and told him that I think his wife is an inconsiderate bitch, that she needs to learn some respect for other people and that I don't want her around me or my kid again for the foreseeable future. He told me that I'm being selfish, she's just trying to help me be a better parent, and that I'm ungrateful. It ended in us basically having a shouting match on the phone and we haven't spoken since. I can totally see their side that she was trying to help/do a nice thing but I repeatedly told her no and she didn't listen, so I think I was justified. Was I, or is my brother right that I'm a raging ungrateful douchebag?", "I(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\nEDIT: throwaway because I don\u2019t want bf to see this\n\nEDIT: WOW I did not expect this to get so many responses. Thank you all for your advice! I haven\u2019t had time to respond to any but I appreciate it. \n\nI have decided just to break it off with him tonight. I\u2019m going to be honest with him and tell him this is why. Even though his behavior is annoying we have still had some fun times and I have known him for a long time so it\u2019s hard, but I\u2019m telling myself this is for the best since I am going to college and he is going to work for his uncle\u2019s business next year, and the long distance thing would have just added another challenge.\n\nOne thing I would like to add is that my boyfriend is still a kid and this is the way he was raised so I don\u2019t think he deserves all the hate on here. He is half black/half Mexican and the Mexican side of the family is veryyy traditional and strictly enforce those gender rules and it seems like it\u2019s a really big deal in their culture (at least to his elders).  He is under pressure to act this way. So yeah there is that cultural divide that I probably should have mentioned but didn\u2019t think to in my OP. ", "I am an office manager at a small office. Today one of our sales people (60F) was getting ready to leave and threw a full cup on water in my trash can. I kindly asked her to please dump the water in the sink (which is about 20 ft from my office) before she throws it away. She said she didn\u2019t understand why she had to do that. I said it\u2019s a request from our cleaning staff and they don\u2019t want to be taking out trash that\u2019s full of water. She still didn\u2019t understand. I asked her if she does that at home and she said no. We went back and forth and she finally took the cup from the garbage and poured out the water. And then she started crying. I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong here. Am I missing something? Is it common for people to put full cups of liquid in a trash can?", "The wedding is in 6 months. To be clear, my husband and I are gay and we were going to attend the wedding but I wasn't going to be in it. (It was discussed at length, but I didn\u2019t want to be the one bridesgroom or whatever). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy friend \"V\" has a great relationship with my 5 y/o and is like an aunt. V asked if she could at least be a flower girl; I was honored and agreed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo weeks ago, V and some friends/family went dress shopping. I couldn\u2019t because my grandma was having surgery that day and I was the only one available/willing to help out. V was a bit bummed and asked if she could bring my kid. I agreed, but explained she\u2019d have to supervise if she went. V said there'd be plenty of people to watch her, so I let her go. When V dropped her off, everyone was all smiles. My kid apparently had a ball. But several days later a mutual friend sent me a link to a post (not Reddit) that she said was written by V. It was technically anon. But once I read it, it was obvious our mutual was right. V hadn't bothered changing many identifying details and just \\*ranted\\* about my kid. The post is now gone, but I copied the text it into a draft email. Technically the whole post didn't center on my kid. But I'll provide some quotes that did:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Not usually bratty but def thinks the sun rises and sets on her IMO. I told her in the car she had to behave and be helpful bc this day was important. But after we got there, she had ppl fussing over her and giving her dresses to try on (when I already said we were not buying her dress today!!) - basically making sure shed be the center of attention.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*She interrupted more than once when ppl commented on the dresses I tried on bc her opinion just HAD to be heard. Usually the comments were not too useful and a tad bit rude IMO. Like I tried on one lacy formfitting dress that I looooved. Before anyone else could say a word she pipes up with \u201cI think its kinda ugly!\u201d Like thaaaanks kid. Geez.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Knocked over a rack of very expensive accessories - after being told TWICE that most things in this shop were  fragile and to touch things gently OR NOT AT ALL. I couldve died but nothing was damaged - thankfully - but I\u2019m like FFS.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were also a few other bizarre comments mixed in about how, although V \u201cloves\u201d my daughter, she \u201cjust has to remind everyone all the time that she\u2019s adorable!!!\u201d.  Honestly, I\u2019m not even sure what that means?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was hurt and confronted V. To her credit, V fessed up/apologized. V said it was just a long day and she was venting. I admit I snapped a bit. First off, I never intended to send my kid in the first place! And if there was a problem, why wouldn't you tell me rather than make a post that anyone could find?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ultimately told V my kid will no longer be in the wedding and that my husband and I think it\u2019s best we just don't attend. Our friend group is split in terms of who they\u2019ve sided with. AITA?", "Okay so I've never used reddit before so forgive me if I get anything wrong here. Just wanted to post on here bc I've seen the videos and twitter threads and that with this sub and thpught maybe y'all could give some insight. \n\nIt's basically what the title says. I'm a vegan - definitely not one of  *those* vegans though. Like I legitimately do not care if someone eats animal products, I just choose not to, partly for ethical reasons and partly because I have various food allergies and a vegan diet is the best way to avoid anything that will nake me ill. I also don't expect to be catered to and am more than happy to bring my own food to parties and things, or eat before/after. \n\nRecently, my flatmate and I hosted a party. She prepared a bunch of non vegan finger food dishes for people and I did some vegan ones - spicy crispy tofu, black bean sliders and tempura veggies with a homemade sweet chili sauce if you're curious. A friend of ours brought her flatmate and he made a big show of being disgusted at all the vegan food, even taking a bite of a black bean slider and spitting it out and retching because \"all vegan food is disgusting and there isn't a single vegan dish he likes.\" I was offended by this because 1. I cook for a living and take pride in my food and 2. That's nust fucking rude anyway. Note: he was incredibly hammered when he did this, but didn't apologise and still hasn't. \n\nNow, since he did that, I've kinda made a point of pointing out when he eats something that is vegan. Like, he has a piece of fruit? I'll say \"you know fruit is vegan right?\". He eats some oreos? I'll say \"oh but I thought you didn't like a single vegan food?\" Etc. He's begun complaining to our mutual friend that I'm being an annoying, preachy vegan. I think I'm just making a point. What do y'all think? AITA?", "I have a friend of mine staying with me that is from out of town. She is here for a few days and is sleeping on the couch in the living room (we don\u2019t have a guest room).\n\nYesterday we all went out (I also have a roommate), and we met up with my boyfriend eventually. When we get back that night me and my bf go in my room to sleep (guest is on couch in living room outside my door, my roommate is in her own room), we decide we want to have sex.\n\nFor reference we have never gotten scolded before or been told we were too loud, and when we had sex last night we made sure to keep it quiet since my friend (guest) was right outside the door in the living room.\n\nI guess she must have heard a little something and got pretty upset. She confronted me just a bit ago asking why we were being disrespectful and why we couldn\u2019t wait to do it after she left (she is here till Sunday). I didn\u2019t really respond, I just nodded my head and said sorry.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong... but I feel that I should be able to have sex at my place with my boyfriend. It\u2019s not like we get super wild if we know others are here, my roommate has also never had an issue with this (and I\u2019ve even brought it up with her just to make sure she\u2019s comfortable in our place!).\n\nSo AITA?", "This is frustrating af so pls bare with me. I've made an alt acc since she knows my personal one.\n\nSo.. WTF.\n\nI've been friends with this girl a year, we started flirting and chatting a lot more a few months ago so I decided to fly over here to visit her and see if we're compatible irl. We are 1k miles apart which is a few hours in a plane. I thought we both genuinely really like each other which is why I came, I wouldn't fly this distance for just anyone and she told me she wanted me to come.\n\nI arrived 3 days ago and at the actual airport she tells me another guy has also come to see her even though she didn't want him to. He's also from another country and flew roughly the same distance to get here. I was confused, cause I don't understand why he flew here if she told him she didn't want him to, like no guy is that stupid as to get on a plane for some random girl. She said it's because he just wanted to travel and picked her country.\n\nSo I've been staying at her house and this other guy got a hotel, so the first day we drove him to his hotel and it was just so awkward. You could tell neither of us wanted to be there anymore, and you can definitely tell we had no idea the other existed. That night we went out for drinks and he came along, despite telling me she didn't want him there. I'm only here for a week and for the past two days the 3 of us have spent the days together and it's so fucking awkward. I really like this girl and I want alone time with her.\n\nSo today I told her I don't want to see him again, that this trip was meant to be for just us and I'm feeling very awkward having another guy around who obviously wants to get in her pants. It's frustrating. She told me we're not exclusive, they're just friends like us, and she doesn't want to leave him alone all day. She specifically said her and I are just friends so I can't get angry.\n\nShe left me alone in her own house, and went to his hotel for a few hours and came back literally half an hour ago (I don't know what they did, they could have had sex for all I know), saying now we could go out for dinner and drinks just us. She had no problem telling me she stayed at his hotel and hang out with him there playing on her switch. So clearly she 100% believes we're not exclusive and told me to chill the fuck out or she couldn't be with me because I'm too overbearing already. I'm not trying to be... but this is a shitty situation and in my eyes we were being flirty af and I didn't know there was another guy coming. Like why couldn't she just pick another week for him to come?\n\nAm I seriously the asshole in this situation?? For being a bit too full on and overbearing? I don't think I am but because of what she told me I just want an outsider's opinion and this sub has helped me before.", "So I realize I\u2019m probably the asshole here. Looking for unbiased responses. \n\nI work in marketing and in my department there are 3-4 women who either have ridiculously wealthy families or have married very wealthy men (our jobs are not that high paying themselves). They talk a lot about expensive things like clothes, shoes, vacations etc. It can get annoying because they very obviously look down on some of our lifestyles. \n\nLast Friday one girl came in with a HUGE diamond ring. It was honestly kinda tacky in my opinion but I didn\u2019t say anything. Someone asked her how much it was and she said it was 45k!!! I was speechless honestly, but she married this private equity guy who could afford it I guess. \n\nLater in the day I was chatting with some other coworkers and I said that I feel like wearing a 45k ring while people in this world are dying of poverty means you\u2019re objectively a bad, morally empty person. I didn\u2019t say it to her directly, but several people were nearby. The people I was talking to all agreed and said it was excessive and not classy at all. \n\nLast night I got a text from my boss saying that word has been spreading that I\u2019m \u201cbullying\u201d this girl and we need to have a chat sometime this week. I\u2019m not sure how casual talk like that can count as bullying but I can see where I maybe went overboard. Now I\u2019m not sure if I should defend myself or just admit fault and apologize when the meeting comes. AITA?", "\n\nAlright so before you get on and yell at me for anything. It's not exactly as harsh as the title might suggested it. So I was dating this guys let's call him John. John and I were an happy couple, I lived everything about him. His personnaility was amazing his physique was a tad feminine but I actually liked it a lot. I was falling in love pretty hard and we never really had a complete relation or sex. We've been together 7 months and he pleasured me but I actually never had the occasion to pleasure him in return. He has told me about 3 months into the relation he had a micropenis and was really shy about this so I didn't really mind doing cuddles and stuff without an actual penetration because I respected him and his insecurities. \n\nNow, foward to 7 months into our relation (about 2 weeks ago). I talked to him and asked him if I could do anything to make him more comfortable because I care for him and I wanted to show him it's not a problem to me. Which really isn't as I'm bi and I don't have any issues with sizes. He said no and told me in a really rude way that it was none of my business and I should just enjoy what he is giving me. I was really sad and frustrated so I left his place and went to a common friend of our. The friend told me that John made her swear to not say anything but in fact she used to be a girl and is on transition for 6 years now but never did the operation. I felt betrayed and lied too. I was so angry. I slept it off. \n\nThe next day I went back to his place and ask him to tell me the truth. He told me I was stupid and it should not matter. I replied it does matter if it's a lie. He told me I was an asshole and I should just love him the way he his and he shouldn't have to specify he was transgender. \nHe clearly soenst see my point and at this point I broke up with him. \n\nNow everyone seems to think I'm this transphobic asshole who left this poor person and his family are sending me messages almost everyday to remind me how awful I am and how bad I broke his heart. \nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here ? \n\n-sorry for my bad English I'm French and my grammar is pretty weak\n\nEdit 1: Thank you for all the comments wow !!! Didn't think this will blow out lie that. So little update. I spoke to him this morning, I told him I was sorry and explained in details what was wrong and why I broke up. He understood and said sorry too. He was really scared that is leave him if I knew and reacted badly because of that, I explained it was the lie and not the actual transgender thing. We agreed to be friends and I'll be sure to help him out when he will go dating I'll be there for him and we are happy like that. His family is still against me but at this point I don't care. In all its an happy ending. We agreed he was mostly the asshole bit I understood and forgave him completely. Thanks again guys !!", "My 19-year-old daughter lives at home with me, and has a 1-year old daughter. During her last year of high school, I supported the baby financially (she did the hands-on stuff, raising of the child) so she could focus solely on school and getting her high school diploma. She had told me she didn\u2019t want to go to college, so I said she\u2019d have to get a job to help with expenses. I\u2019d help her pay for daycare, but she\u2019d have to start contributing.\n\nNow, I did know that she smokes some pot. It\u2019s illegal without a medical marijuana card in our state, but I wasn\u2019t too pressed about it to begin with because she doesn\u2019t do it in front of the baby and only smokes with her friends when she goes out. She obviously can\u2019t afford pot and I won\u2019t give her money for it (I go out and buy the stuff the baby needs with her, so I know she\u2019s not spending the baby money on pot). So, she doesn\u2019t do it often, only when she goes out with friends and they supply it, which isn\u2019t often since she had the little one.\n\nRecently, she applied for a job at a grocery store and she got an interview. She told me they really liked her and were eager to hire her, all she had to do was take a drug test. She hadn\u2019t been out with her friends in a while, so I figured she would be fine. A few weeks passed since the interview and I asked if she had heard back. She said no. I encouraged her to call, because they had been so enthusiastic and now radio silence. So, she called and then told me she failed her drug test. I was confused and asked when she smoked pot. She said her friend had given her some as a gift and she had done it one day when I took the baby out, not long before the test but after she knew she had to take it. She said it was such a low amount, she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d show up on the test.\n\nI was pretty pissed. I don\u2019t care if she smokes, but if it\u2019s a company policy, it\u2019s a company policy and how could she not realize it would show up? How could she sabotage a good job opportunity (this store pays above minimum wage, one of the few in our state who does and treats it\u2019s employees great, it\u2019s not a forever job, but it\u2019s a damn good job for someone with a high school diploma)?\n\nFinally, I asked her if she had anymore pot and she said yes. She brought it to me and I told her I was going to be getting rid of it. I said she was to be applying to jobs every single day and prove to me that she was doing so.\n\nMy wife thinks I\u2019m being too harsh for a one-time mistake. I don\u2019t think so. I think this was a dumbass choice and that she ruined a good thing. She can smoke pot, when a drug test isn\u2019t an option. My daughter also finds this unfair, but has been following up on what I asked.\n\nAm I being an ass?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: People are asking why a grocery store is drug testing. She\u2019s not working a regular cashier job, she applied to work in the back, where heavy machinery is involved (she was going to be taking tests, getting licenses, etc.). That\u2019s why they drug tested. You can\u2019t do drugs and operate heavy machinery.", "I'm 28, girlfriend is 27. She has a 2 year old with her ex, 28, who is in the picture. They have joint custody. I own my own house, she has an apartment, he has an apartment. We've been dating seven months.\n\nMy house is closer to the daughter's daycare than my girlfriend's apartment. So I offered to her to hang out at my place and then we'd all have dinner together a couple nights a week. Whenever the girlfriend doesn't have her daughter with her, nightly dinners are usually a thing anyways, so instead of 4 times a week, it happens every day a week. And I don't mind!\n\nThe problem is I get home from work about two hours after daycare is over. So she spends those two hours playing with her daughter in my living room, giving her a snack, etc. I'm getting tired of the snacking, because her idea of snacking is giving her a bowl of cheerios or crackers or whatever, the bowl inevitably gets toppled or spilled onto the floor within 10 seconds, and the daughter smooshes them up leaving crumbs everywhere. \n\nThe girlfriend doesn't clean it, and I have to clean it when I get home. But sometimes I don't catch it all, especially when she decides to smoosh cookies into my couch cushions. I've started to get ants, localized in my living room. I've never had ants before, and I worry about what's next. Cockroaches? Mice?\n\nI warned her to be more attentive of her daughter and if she makes a mess to clean it up. I even bought her some bowls that suction cup to my coffee table so it at least prevents some mess, but she doesn't use them and doesn't clean up. I told her the nuclear option is coming: no more daughter at my house until she's capable of being cleaner, and the girlfriend says I'm punishing the child for something she can't control.\n\nI'm not punishing the daughter, I'm punishing my girlfriend. If she won't clean up the mess her daughter makes, then I don't want an opportunity for the mess to occur. The daughter isn't the issue, the girlfriend is the issue, by not cleaning up or being attentive enough.\n\nWell, it happened. I banned the daughter from coming here after daycare. This puts pressure on my girlfriend because if she wants to have a dinner with the three of us here, she needs to travel 40min home, wait until I get home, and then another 40min here. This isn't only time, but money. She called me an asshole for \"making the life of a single mom harder\" but she dug her own grave.\n\nAITA?", "Ok so some background. Ever since high school I'd walk around without my shirt or socks on when I'm just relaxing in my own home since I have hyperhidrosis and I sweat terribly through my armpits and feet and I dont like wearing damp clothes (IDK why it just really bothers me, I change socks like 3 times a day). In college I was self-conscious about my family always hounding me to eat more and put on weight so I started working out and never stopped, so I got reasonably large, as one would expect. Later, I moved in with my current roommate who at the time was single but eventually got a girlfriend. In the past I'd usually put on a shirt when I'm just chilling in the living room but I never put a shirt on when I'm hanging out in my room and I'm just leaving to grab a drink or something. When his GF first started coming over to the apartment I'd obviously make sure I looked presentable (showered, fully clothed, etc), but then she started coming over regularly and I started to get more comfortable with her. One day she was over again (at this point she started practically living here) and I finally thought \"Nah I dont need to throw a shirt on to go get a drink\". So I left my room no shirt or socks and did my business, while they watched Netflix on the living room coach. I did this throughout the day to make a sandwich or dinner or to grab another drink or something. Sometimes I'd make small talk with her like ask her how's she's doing and stuff, and then go back to my room. At the time I didn't think anything of it, but then the next day he came up to me and told me that they both thought I was trying to \"flex on him\" and hit on his GF or some shit (I'm single right now) in the douchiest/creepiest way possible. He then told me we'd have problems if I kept \"being weird around his GF\". At this point I got kinda pissed (it's not a big deal for me to throw a shirt on but just the way he approached me about it pissed me off) and told him that I'm the one who pays rent, not this semi-permanent resident of a GF so I'll walk around my apartment however the fuck I want. He thinks I'm an ass, I disagree. AITA?\n\nEdit: For clarification, the GF wasn't like psyched about it but she wasn't really uncomfortable or too mad about it either. It was mostly my roommate who had the problem with it. Also the GF had lived in the apartment for a week straight at this point (as in sleeping, showering, and eating here) Which I honestly don't mind since it's his apartment too. Part of the reason I was mad was that I thought that should afford me the right to walk around shirtless than. I'm not sure that how that stuff works though.\n\nFinal edit: I only small talked with his GF because that's my way of being nice, since I'm not super close to her. I feel like I don't need to do the same to my roommate since I've known him for some time now, so we don't \"small talk\" all that much, maybe that's wrong though. Lastly, I only mentioned working out since I think that's part of the reason he was mad. I think he'd be less mad if I was thinner, but then again this is just my side of the story, up for your interpretation.", "Recently, my 13 year old daughter came home upset about getting into an argument with another girl over a soccer game in PE. My daughter isn\u2019t the most athletic, but her friend plays soccer year-round. \n\nIn this specific game, my daughter got into an argument with her friend; my daughter kicked the ball into the goal but her friend, who was the goalie and inattentive in the moment, claimed that there was NO WAY my daughter could have kicked it in. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s because my daughter probably failed to do so during numerous other attempts, but my daughter thought that this girl was putting her down when she had just started to improve at soccer. \n\nThen, that one argument got a lot nastier and they started fighting over random things not even related to soccer. However, after a while, my daughter expressed wanting to still be friends and make things up with that girl. I told her to send an apology email, call that friend, or talk to the girl in person about it. \n\nUnfortunately, that didn\u2019t work, and the girl told my daughter that she never thought my daughter would change and that they would never be friends again. My daughter started crying, but I found it very hard to comfort or feel sympathy for her. I am a very solutions-focused, practical person. At 13, I would have said, \u201cto hell with that girl, I\u2019m 13 and in 4.5 years I won\u2019t ever see her again. Good riddance.\u201d \n\nI told her that, and I also said, \u201cAll girls fight, and at 13 I thought you would have known that by now.\u201d I mean, as an adult, you\u2019re just so swamped with things that stress you out way more than some teenage drama that they\u2019ll both forget about by the time they\u2019re 35. \n\nMy daughter carried on crying and came into my husband and I\u2019s bedroom to cry and vent some more at about 10 PM. I made her leave by 12 am because it was late and I start work at 8 AM. I am honestly pretty angry about the whole situation because my daughter even missed her zero period biology class over crap like this.\n\nI wanted to teach my daughter a different approach: that not everyone deserves your heavy emotions, like that girl, conflict resolution skills, life skills: that all women are catty (I have coworker spats with girls I work with and I never feel down because I just know all women are like that), and just how to let things go. I don\u2019t want my daughter to pity herself when stuff like this happens. \n\nInstead of going to class, my kid instead spent her morning waking up her grandma (my mom) and crying and venting to her. Later, my mom called me and said that I needed to have more patience and empathy for my daughter, and that I should have given her a hug or two, even though my mom KNOWS I\u2019m not a touchy person and don\u2019t even hug my husband, whom I arguably love a smidgen more than my daughter. My sister even called me as well and said that I was \u201ctoo cold\u201d towards my daughter. \n\nThen, when she did go back to school, my kid even told her \"FAVORITE\" TEACHER about this. Why would you tell a stranger about your personal problems when you have FAMILY, like your MOM, to help you? My daughter even came home and told me that she sometimes wanted said teacher to be her mom sometimes! I don't know where that came from and why! I've been here for 13 years and her teacher has known her for like, less than a year.\n\nI\u2019m so confused now. AITA?", "First some info: \nI live with my roommate in a 2 bedroom apartment \nI work night shifts so I dont know who he brings home at night\nHe works a regular daytime job so we barely see each other or talk\nHe has (had) a longterm hs sweetheart gf that I know personally\n\nNow for the main part:\nAround 10am, so at a time I was sound asleep, I heard an insistent knocking, followed by my phone blowing up, followed again by knocking and so on. I go open the door and there's my roommate's gf, looking like she ran here. Im not very friendly when rudely awoken so i just barked \"what\". She apologised a 1000 times and asked if she can get a pendrive she gave her bf and that it is VERY urgent bc she forgot to copy something that was on it. I admit I was barely listening but she looked in a hurry and I just wanted to go back to sleep so I let her.\n\nMy friend is not a tidy person exactly so I wasnt surprised when she couldnt find it on the desk and just started going through his stuff. I just went to living room and sat on the couch until she finally left the room (i kinda fell asleep so idk how long she was there). She acted weird when she woke me to close the door. I asked if she has everything cause \"I am NOT leaving the bed again\" and she just said that she is not coming back for sure and i just let her out and locked the door and went back to sleep.\n\nLater that day Im at work and my phone is blowing up and it's my roommate (weird bc he never calls me at work). I call him back when I have a sec thinking someone died or smth and he's screaming and shit.\n\nLong story short (bc that was a really long and confusing convo) - he brought some girl home (as he aparrently sometimes does), did the deed and she left some evidence behind that he didnt bother throwing out because he never expected anyone to go through his shit, much less the gf. Well his gf broke up with him later the same day and he blames me for her finding out and ruining the relationship.\n\nSo like, AITA? I mean yeah maybe I shouldnt have let her in or should watch her do wtv she did but I was sleep deprived and I didnt know he even was hiding something, yk?", "Two days ago I was having dinner with friends (all female) at a friend's house.\n\nAfter dinner I was in the kitchen helping our host, one of my best friends, with dishes, and we began talking about our problems and such. Important: my friend has lost her mother to cancer 5 years ago. Anyway, I opened up and told her I'm in a shitty mood lately due to a combination of my father's serious health problems and my SO potentially losing his job (the firm is having financial troubles and they'll likely have to fire someone, and he's not been with them for a very long time).\n\nI paused, waiting for her comforting reaction, but I saw she was smiling. She then said: \"Oh, I'm sorry, it's just that I was thinking how lucky you are... your father's health will get better soon\". Excuse me? Confused, I replied: \"What do you mean? We are waiting for the results and either way he's not doing very good\". \"Yeah, but... it's probably not cancer, right?\" I didn't know what to reply and she went on, \"you're lucky\". Finally I understood where she was going and I kept silent. \"I don't know, I think your issues are easy to overcome compared to what I had to go through\".\n\nI was so upset that she would bring this into our conversation, I mean, what the fuck?! I was hoping for a nice word, or even silence would have been better, but no, she had to make this about herself. I still remained silent because rage was boiling inside me, but she didn't notice apparently because she said \"At least you still have your mother\".\n\nI couldn't stand it anymore and snapped, \"Are you trying to make me feel guilty or something? You don't need to make everything about yourself and your mother, and besides, life goes on\". I left her in the kitchen and went back to the living room with the rest of my friends.\n\nWhen she joined us a couple of minutes later she tried to look neutral. We didn't directly speak to each other throughout the rest of the evening and when I got home I started feeling guilty about what I had said. I shouldn't have snapped like that but I was very upset and disappointed that she chose not to comfort me but to minimize my issues.\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "Throwaway for professional reasons.\n\nI (24m) am a tattoo artist with quite a large following online. For those of you who aren't really into tattoo culture, a big issue in the community is tattoo copying. This is essentially when someone takes a tattoo someone has, and gets another artist to trace the design and get it on them. This is seen as stealing within the community (as designs for us are sold) and is incredibly disrespectful. Any decent artist will not copy a tattoo. I've spoken a lot about this online, as it happens to me a lot, as well as other artists I know.\n\nLast week I had a woman come in for an appointment with me. She was heavily tattooed (I mention this because I think it makes it less likely that she didn't know that tattoo copying is wrong) and two of those were stolen designs I had done on another client. One of them was meaningful to the client, the other was a flash design I did. She showed me the tattoos after I finished designing the tattoo for her that she was getting that day. The conversation went something like:\n\n\"I saw these two tattoos on your instagram and had to have them. They're actually done really well and were a good way to tide me over until I could get to you\"\n\n\"Uh, thanks? Just for the future, most artists don't appreciate it when you copy their work. Those tattoos are supposed to be one-offs.\"\n\n\"It's a compliment though, really\"\n\n\"Haven't you ever heard of this issue?\"\n\n\"Yeah I've heard all the drama about copying tattoos, but I don't see why it's an issue. I wouldn't care if someone copied mine so, who cares.\"\n\nThat's when I got quite mad. I told her that not only is she acting very ignorant, she is disrespectful and essentially stealing my artwork (she hadn't changed either of the designs at all). I told her to get out of my shop and not to return, as we don't tattoo people who don't respect the industry. I also didn't refund her \u00a3100 deposit as she still spent time in the studio getting a design drawn when I could have had another client.\n\nShe left a review saying I'm an asshole. The rest of my studio agreed with me on the issue, but we all agree we can see how someone outside the industry might not agree. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: just to clarify, the deposit was for the design itself. It was a large design that was going to take up her whole thigh, so it took a long time to draw up. I could have had another client in that time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the feedback. There's a lot of debate in the comments so I just wanted to give a brief, general overview of what is generally seen as stealing when it comes to tattoos:\n\nStealing:\n\n\\- Taking a picture of another tattoo to an artist and asking for the exact same thing, with no changes.\n\nNot stealing:\n\n\\- Getting a pop culture tattoo. A large corporation cannot tattoo you and you are therefore not taking away potential income from anyone by taking a picture of Mickey Mouse to a tattoo artist.\n\n\\- Taking inspiration from other tattoos. Taking pictures of tattoos to your artist and saying 'I like this, can I get something similar/with a few changes?' is fine.\n\n\\- Buying a design from an artist (tattoo or otherwise) and asking an artist to tattoo it on you.\n\n\\- Getting permission from the original artist AND the client with the tattoo (although finding an artist who will copy another's tattoo is generally an indication of their quality).", "This happened years ago on a Ryanair flight and is obviously not a big deal, but to this day I wonder if how I acted was okay or assholish.\n\nSo I was sitting in my seat during the flight and got up to pee and change my pad (as - TMI - I was on a heavy day of my period and worried about leakage). I wait in line in front of the lavatory, 2 or 3 people in front of me already waiting as well. After 5-10 minutes it's finally my turn and I move to enter. \n\nJust then a little kid (4-5 years, maybe?) comes running down the aisle, his dad walking a few feet behind him, and kiddo tries to squeeze past my legs into the lavatory as I'm opening the door. I hold my arm out in front of the child and say kindly but firmly \"No, you have to wait in line like I did, it's not your turn.\" Dad says nothing and I move into the stall and close the door. I felt like I was in the right because I had waited in line, I really had to change my pad soon or there'd be blood on my pants, and I thought I was being fair and polite letting the kid know why he had to wait.\n\nSomeone gives a few firm knocks on the door but I just say \"occupied!\" and quickly do my business. As I exit the restroom the dad and child are gone, presumably to use the lavatory in the back of the plane. A male flight attendant, however, is waiting next to the door and in a tone like he has to school an idiot says \"What you did was very rude, that was just a child, what if that was an emergency?\" In an admittedly snippy tone I replied \"What if it was an emergency for me too?\" and went back to my seat.\n\nDoes not letting a child go first automatically make me the asshole, like that flight attendant thought? I would've let kid and dad cut in line if they'd asked, and feel bad because obviously a child can't hold it in like an adult can, but because of the whole trying to squeeze past me approach, my gut reaction was \"no way\".", "Yes. I get it. She is 16. She has a boyfriend. They've been together for more than an year. And they are probably having sex. \n\nBut they do stuff behind closed doors whenever he is here. And I don't want to know anything about it. So on Sunday, when we were having breakfast, I bought this up. I told my daughter that she can't do anything sexual when they are in the house. At this point my daughter started crying and she was like- \"We are not allowed to do anything in our house and his house. Where should we do anything then? On the street?\". She left after that. \n\nMy husband had a wtf expression on his face. And he agreed with her and told me that it would be unsafe to do anything outdoors and it is better if they did it under supervision. I just can't believe it. I thought my husband would support me. Was I the asshole here?", "Okay, this will make a lot more sense after you've read this (duh).\nSo get ready because I won't make a \"tl;dr\" ;D\n\n\nBackstory: \nTwo days ago my company installed new firealarms  in our office building. \nIn January we began building a second office complex right besides \nour main facility. That new building has no firealarms installed yet.\nI later figured that you can't hear the alarms from the main building there.\nWe're also renovating the main building (where I & said co-workers work). \nSince Monday the toilets in our complex are being renovated so we can't \nuse them.\nFortunately the toilets in the new building work fine, so we just go there\nfor now...\n\n\nEnough backstory? Good.\n\n--- Here we go... ---\n\nSo, this happened about 4 hours ago. I was working on my desk\nand minding my own business when suddenly the firealarm went\noff.\n\n\nAt first I thought: \n\"well, the firealarms were just installed, maybe it's just a minor malfunction.\"\nHowever we took the alarm serious and evacuated the office building.\n\n\nWhile we were on the way out I noticed that two of my (female)\nco-workers (let's call them Abby & Shelly) were not in our \"evacuation group\". \nI remembered that both of them went to the restroom literally 5 minutes before the\nalarms went off. It takes a couple minutes to get to the toilets in the\nother building so I figuered they'd still have to be there. Since there are\nno firealarms in that new building (and there's only one way out) they\ncould've been in great danger.\n\n\nThere was no visible smoke or fire, which was good. I didn't see \nAbby & Shelly on the way there or around the restroom so I opened the door...\n\n\nAbby stood right behind the door and looked at me in shock, while Shelly\nwas washing her hands - she too looked shocked.\n\n\nI told them without further ado that there might be a fire in the building \nand the alarms went off. I also told them that we have to get out of there.\n\n\nThey both got very angry at me for opening the women's restroom without\nany warning. And they kept telling me that on the entire way out. They said\n\"there would be consequences\".\n\n\nWhen we finally got out Abby and Shelly went for a group of other women\nand told them \"what I did\". But the group didn't really understand why\nthey were so angry, after all, I only tried to help...\n\n\nWe all got to take the rest of the day off...\n\n\nMoving on...\n\nIt turns out someone left the kettle (water cooker) in the break room on \nwhich resulted in an electric bypass. The kitchen counter and some chairs\nburned down. Gladly the fire fighters stopped the fire before it spread in\nthe building...\n\n\nAnyways, if you've made it to down here let me know what you guys think...\n\n\n\nEDIT: Can't believe this got so much attention.\nSo my boss phoned me this evening and told me \"Abby & Shelly\" spoke to him about the \"incident\". He too told me that their reactions were absolutely insane. \n\nThank all of you for responding to this post. \n\n\n\nEDIT2: \nSo after reading all of your comments for the last hours I've realized that this might not have been \nthe right sub for this situation. Maybe to clarify a bit: I'm a bit awkward tbh and talking to people isn't my\nstrongest ability. I often don't realize when I screwed up and I believed that posting this here would make\nthings more understandable for myself. Maybe I posted this because I wanted certainty.\n\nBut after reading all of your feedback I'm certain that this post isn't suited for r/AmITheAsshole\n\nThis thread has grown into something greater than I ever thought. I won't/can't just delete this.\nI'll leave this to the Mods of this sub, if they think deleting this post is a necessity.\n\nThank all of you for your time.", "I have been with her for 10.5 months. She knows I invest, when we started dating, I told her I invest on the stock market on the side when we were talking about careers and what we do. My brother approached me and asked if I would invest in his new business. He showed me a plan all the stuff and I think it looks good. He needed a large sum of money and has already gotten some from me and other investors, I honestly he is gonna succeed, he is motivated, experienced and won\u2019t be too emotional about it.\n\nWhen me and my girlfriend were having dinner, I told her about it and how I was excited for him. She said cool, I am excited for him, how much money did you invest. I told her the number and she got really mad. She said how she could have paid off all of her debt and bought the new car she needed. I then told her that she shouldn\u2019t hypothetically spend my money and it wasn\u2019t hers anyway. I also reminded her that we don\u2019t even live together or are engaged so I don\u2019t think she should worry. She got up, paid the bill (it was her turn) and left.

Recently I was diagnosed with a very rare form of brain cancer and while we caught it early enough doctors believe I\u2019m a high risk for relapse in the future. Essentially I have been given 15 years max to live. Recently I held a WIG party where my hardiresser and close friends brought in wigs and shaved my head. This is where the problem starts. Kat has been sucked into one of those essential oil MLM\u2019s and has become somewhat of a soul sucking banshee but despite all that she\u2019s been supportive of me in the past and she\u2019s still my best friend. I\u2019ve dealt with her saying her oils could do better for me than chemo and telling me I\u2019m just killing myself faster by not using her oils so I\u2019ve been close to my breaking point for awhile. I finally broke when Kat showed up without a wig or food but with a huge poster board of her MLM along with some of the products she sells. I of course started sobbing and all of our friends ripped Kat a new one. Kat has sent me some pretty nasty emails saying I\u2019m not supportive and her mom has called my mom to scream about how ungrateful I am. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my emotions being out of sorts or the anxiety of everything going on but I feel like a huge asshole. \n\n\n\n\n**EDIT** I\u2019ve decided to have a sit down with Kat along with four of our mutual friends. I plan on telling her she\u2019s out of line with her MLM stuff and that I\u2019ve tried to be supportive of it but I can\u2019t any longer. My friends and I are essentially planning an intervention. In the future if or when she apologizes I may consider recconecting but right now I\u2019m too hurt to even look at her. My mother also lost a friend today (Kats mother) over the whole debacle and we\u2019re both very very emotionally exhausted.

Baxter my older dog has started having problems with his hips in the past year or so, to the point that I have to help him get up the stairs for bed. I give him stuff (from my vet) for the pain when he seems to be having a pretty bad night but don't keep him stoned all the time. He has good and bad days and on his good days I still take him for walks but I've noticed he gets tired really quick so we have to cut it short.\n\nI have always taken Baxter and Soldier out together whether it's just to do their business or to go on walks. The problem is I have noticed that Soldier seems to be going a little stir crazy since the walks have become shorter and shorter. He will act like he needs to go poop when he really doesn't and he has never done that before. If he says he needs to go then he needs to go.\n\nI know if I take Soldier out by himself for longer walks Baxter is going to get super upset. But I don't want to push Baxter past his limits and cause him more pain and I don't want to punish Soldier because he's younger and is still full of energy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I started taking Soldier out by himself so he can get more exercise knowing it is going to hurt my other dogs feelings?\n\nAlso if anyone has a better solution any suggestions would be welcome.\n\nEdit 2: Baxter is a medium sized German Shephard and Jerky McJerkface mix (I honestly have no idea, I took him from a girl at work when he was a puppy because she got evicted and was going to take him to the pound back when they still put dogs down and didn't treat against parvo) So trying to lift him into strollers or wagons would be a big strain on my back.\n\nAnd trust me he is Jerky McJerkface.. he ate my Dad's fake teeth one night when he left them sitting on the table wrapped in a paper towel.

For context, I\u2019m in the US so unpaid maternity leave for up to 12 weeks. I\u2019m lucky enough to get paid in full for one paycheck and partial payment for the next 3.

I\u2019ve told her on several occasions (mostly off hand) that I\u2019ll be pretty preoccupied with my newborn. It\u2019s kind of been brushed off until today. \n\nMy mom called and once again said she is bringing up wedding craft stuff for me to help with once the baby\u2019s here.

If you\u2019re not, it\u2019s a program that goes on in elementary schools where you go with your child early that morning and you sit with them, usually in the auditorium, have a doughnut (or 3) and listen to an administrator show you love, or if you\u2019re me, just hang out w your kid before school starts...\n\n...only it doesn\u2019t happen. \n\nMy daughter is heading to the 3rd grade. Meaning I\u2019ve been to these things twice (skipped last year, she was sick). Each time we\u2019ve gone (me, my munchkin and her bio dad), we\u2019ve had to sit through an hour and a half of the administrators explain to us \u201chow to be better parents to our children\u201d. Last time we were given a sheet of paper that had the \u201c5 T\u2019s\u201d, Talk, Time, some other nonsense, you get it. The time before that, we were lectured on how there should be more men in the seats than there were, like we could control that. That very same year, a mother was in the stands (hats off to you ma\u2019am) and was singled out by the principal and told us that she is setting an example for us. Like wtf?\n\n\nAnd what makes matters worse, I tell my wife and she\u2019s shocked. Tells me that\u2019s ridiculous and that never happens at Muffins for Moms (same thing but for mothers). She explains to me that they get a potted plant and the school damn near bows down to them. There was even an instance where the vice principal was preaching (as in \u201ccan I get an amen\u201d preaching) going on about how moms \u201care the first ones to wake up and the last ones to go to bed\u201d and the \u201clast ones to eat at night\u201d and my wife blatantly said she did none of those things, her husband does (my wife is the shit, y\u2019all don\u2019t even know). \n\n\nThis ain\u2019t an anti mom post cuz my wife is an AMAZING mother, I\u2019m a mamas boy, and I\u2019m all about the women/mama movement, y\u2019all amaze me every day. But I feel like it can be a little (for lack of a better word) dangerous for the kids to see mama handed a flower pot and for dad to be read the riot act. It\u2019s already bad in entertainment, tv shows, etc. where dad as the aloof, derpy, Patrick Star-type of adult. \n\n\nBut anyway, on to my question. WIBTA by emailing the principal and suggesting to change up the way they do things when it comes to DfD? Not just for the sake of my own (admittedly) selfishness but so my daughter won\u2019t keep being told that \u201cDad(s) have to do better\u201d?", "A couple of my friends and I play Dungeons and Dragons one night a week. We started out with the five of us, including myself then added one more person when we started a new campaign. We are all in the age range of 18-22. We usually switch up between each other\u2019s houses every week. \n\nThe most recent person to join us is a person who has transitioned from a male to a female. I did not know her until about two weeks ago when she joined us. She is a friend of another person in my friend group.\n\nThe problem started the first night she played with us. I use words such as \u2018bro\u2019 or \u2018dude\u2019 when addressing people, regardless of gender. I am a woman and if someone called me \u2018bro\u2019 I would literally not care an ounce. She became mad at me because I said: \u201cBro, use your \u2018spell that I can\u2019t remember now\u2019!\u201d and again later when I said \u201cHey dude, can you pass me my drink?\u201d\n\nShe called me insensitive because she identifies as a woman now and doesn\u2019t want to be referred to as a male. That wasn\u2019t my intention at all, and is just how I speak. When I have spoke to her or about her, I am very good about only adressing her as \u2018she\u2019 or \u2018her\u2019. I apologized to her, even though I didn\u2019t feel as if I was in the wrong, because again I speak to everyone that way.  I stopped talking to her directly for the rest of the night because I didn\u2019t want to have to worry about saying anything else to offend her. \n\nAfter the first time she played with us, she texted her friend who introduced her to our friend group and told him that she thinks I am a bigot and transphobic.  Which I am not, she shouldn\u2019t expect me to change my way of speaking just to accommodate her and her way of life and resort to calling me a bigot just because I slipped up. \n\nI was pretty offended to be called transphobic just because I dropped the word \u2018bro\u2019 or \u2018dude\u2019 once during the night. I wasn\u2019t using any slurs or derogatory speech towards her, again this is just how I have spoken for the past 20 years. This week we decided to play at my house and I texted in our group chat that she was more than welcome to come, however I wouldn\u2019t be censoring myself in my own home and if she didn\u2019t like that then she wasn\u2019t invited to join. 3 of my friends said that I was totally in the right, however the other two think I\u2019m being an asshole and could go a couple hours without saying \u2018bro\u2019 or \u2018dude\u2019. \n\nI feel like that\u2019s not the point, and I should be able to enjoy myself with my friends, without worrying about using an innocent word and offending someone.  So AITA?", "Our dog passed three days ago. She predated my daughter and even my wife, so it was especially hard on me. We had a little burial in our backyard where my daughter (8) said a few words. We put her favorite blanket, and toy in the coffin I made and I buried her.\n\nBut, unbeknownst to me, my daughter snuck in another toy. I had a stuffed penguin I've had for nearly 15 years, it was something I bought for my previous dog before she passed, and this new dog played with it a lot, too. I wanted to keep this toy forever because it represented two dogs I've owned, not just the one. I kept it on my home office desk and had no intention of ever getting rid of it.\n\nI guess my daughter thought it should be with her too, so she took it, put it in the coffin, and I buried it. I only found out today after asking her where the penguin went. Obviously I'm not going to get mad at her for this, but this cut deep. No fault of her own, she didn't know, but I'm left with a hard decision.\n\nI think tonight when everyone's asleep, I'm going to dig up the coffin, pry it open, get the penguin back, and then rebury the coffin. I made mention of this to my wife, as a joke to gauge her reaction, and she said it was a dark joke and no sane person would do that.

My wife called me in tears telling me about it. We talked about it, obviously I was shocked at this news. We knew that our daughter was having sex with her boyfriend, and we also knew they were using condoms, so all of this was just very shocking to us. I told my wife to call me tomorrow again, and that we can talk about it on Tuesday when I get back. She then got very angry at me, saying it was RIDICULOUS that I wouldn't come home as soon as possible. I just told her, the business trip is important, I cant just miss it unless there is a very serious emergency, and she got very upset at the idea that this wasn't an 'emergency'. Its not. Its obviously extremely worrisome, but its not as if the baby is going to pop out of her tomorrow. She has plenty of time to think of what she is going to do with her kid, and we have plenty of time to discuss it. I talked to my daughter, I didn't even really know what to say, I knew she didn't intend for this to happen. I felt terrible for her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried telling my wife how important it was for me to be in chicago for this trip. This was months in the making, I cant just leave. She was not listening, she was just furious at me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?", "We've been together for a year now and we're both 25. He has a big black lab, weighs around 80lbs that I swear he loves more than me. The dog never leaves his side, is always looking at him, and acts like an 80 pound lapdog towards him. Most nights before bed he'll get down on all fours and wrestle with her for ~10 minutes. They then go get a snack together. \n\n\n\n\nI've always thought the wrestling was weird but never said anything. Tonight he was doing it again. He doesn't use his hands or arms. Literally on all fours, they touch faces and push each other back and forth. Literally like two sumo wrestlers trying to push each other around with their body. I got annoyed tonight and told him to stop acting so fucking weird and get up off the floor. He asked me to leave and now I'm typing this from my apartment. Am I the asshole here?", "Don\u2019t want to make this too long, but need to provide a bit of context. My niece just finished her school year And is staying with my husband and I for much of the summer. It\u2019s nice because own daughter is 13 and they\u2019re very close. More importantly it gives my niece the chance to spend time with my parents (her grandparents) who are elderly. \n\nI don\u2019t have a pool so when the girls want to swim, we go to my parents\u2019. They live in a condo complex with a communal pool. I would say that the majority of the people in this complex are older/retired. And we live in a fairly reserved community overall. \n\nI have noticed that my niece has been getting a lot of..looks..from people when she wears her swim suits. It\u2019s hard to describe the bottoms but most of her butt shows in them (I\u2019m not sure if quite counts as a thong, but it sort of looks like that to me). And the bikini tops don\u2019t leave much to the imagination. I don\u2019t think people are looking at her in a pervy way. More like they\u2019re a bit shocked. My mom hasn\u2019t said much but every time my niece would get out of the pool, she\u2019d practically tackle her with towels and this mesh cover up thing, which was almost comical. \n\nAnyway, I pulled my niece aside the other day and asked if she had any suits that showed a little...less. She said the suits she packed were all the same style, so I offered to go shopping and buy her something. I tried to explain my reasoning and approach the issue gently. But I think I offended her nonetheless. \n\nI was feeling a bit bad so I asked my husband if I went about this the wrong way.  The whole topic seemed to make him uncomfortable though so I just dropped it. Anyway, it would be nice to get some neutral perspectives over whether I was wrong here.", "Background info: We\u2019ve been living together for 5 years and recently had a baby, he\u2019s 4 months old. \n\nA few weeks ago we were at a family gathering on a Sunday night and out of no where she got blacked out drunk. At the time she was staying home with the baby while I worked 5 days a week from 8-6. She would get up during the night to soothe the baby when he woke up crying or needed to be breastfed. She obviously couldn\u2019t do that this night so I was pissed that she didn\u2019t talk to me before to set up a plan for care and that I had to stay up with the baby on a Sunday night with work the next day (and other reasons, see edit 2). I asked if we could leave the baby with my parents and pick him up the next day so I could get sleep and function at work but she refused since we had not done any overnights with our baby yet (wouldn\u2019t have be a viable solution anyway, see edit 2). I got really pissed off at the whole situation and called her an irresponsible bitch (yes I know IATA for not keeping my cool and lashing out like this). I drove home and we didn\u2019t say a word to each other. \n\nWhen we got home she almost fell walking up the stairs. Then she took the baby, and **I urged her to let me take care of the baby that night** and told her to sleep it off on the couch. Since she was pissed from what I said earlier, she refused. At this point I was worried about the baby\u2019s safety as she could hardly stand on her own but she refused to give me the baby saying \u201che\u2019s my kid\u201d. This triggered me and I told her that I was going to call the cops if she didn\u2019t give me the baby, at which point she said \u201cgo ahead they always side with the mom\u201d, so I did. The cops did not side with her, told her to sleep it off while I rocked the baby to sleep in another room. I felt like shit calling the cops on her, and we\u2019ve never had a fight like this but as a new parent this was the only thing I could think of to get our baby out of her hands and into mine as she was doing this out of spite because of what I said to her in the car. AITA?\n\n**Edit:** I want to say that when the cops arrived, I stressed that I only wanted to care for the baby and for her to sleep it out. In no way did I want them to take any action against her. We also live about an hour and a half from the nearest relative.\n\nAnd as a new parent, I felt for the first time ever what it feels like to fear for your child\u2019s safety which is why I think I took it to that extreme, even though I regret doing it now.\n\n**Edit 2:** I guess it\u2019s too late for this now, but there\u2019s a reason why I was upset about having to take over for the night aside from having to work the next day. I already know IATA for cursing at her. The reason for the post was for calling the cops, but everyone is judging on what I said or assuming that I didn\u2019t want to take care of my kid for the night.\n\nThat Friday I tried watching the baby alone while she had a girls night out. Turns out that when a baby is that young and spends 24/7 with their mom, they become attached and reliant on them for comfort **(I was either at work or commuting 90% of the day, obviously I couldn\u2019t spend that much time with my child, but I seem to be getting crucified for this).** About an hour in when it got close to his bedtime, he started having a meltdown. For an hour straight, I tried everything in the book to soothe him but nothing worked. I had never heard him cry like that before, I was freaking out. My cousin, who also has a newborn and a couple of older kids was with me at the time and he even said it was time to call mom, as we started to worry about the distress the baby was in. As soon as she got back and held him, he instantly stopped crying. We were amazed but realized that we definitely had to work on him getting more comfortable with me. Needless to say I was kind of traumatized with the experience - I don\u2019t do well when my baby cries like that (severe distressed crying), I literally start crying as well (I\u2019ve gotten better with that since then). Then two days later, this happened. So yeah, it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to \u201cwatch my baby for one night\u201d, it was me literally reliving that Friday and pissed that she got drunk knowing that the baby nor I were not ready for a night without her yet. Regardless, **I urged her to let me watch the baby that night.**\n\n**info:** Since apparently \u201cI\u2019m a terrible dad that should have the baby taken away from me\u201d, we talked about it the next day and realized we both fucked up. We both acted irrationally but we\u2019ve been going through a whirlwind of emotions as first time parents. I\u2019ve just never stopped feeling guilty about calling the cops. She\u2019s now back to work and I\u2019m staying home with the baby for a month and a half and I\u2019m glad to say he has bonded to me on a level similar to his mom.", "I (22M) went to a restaurant/bar and got ID'd by the waitress behind the bar. We were having a light convo and she said ''Yeah you look about 12''.\n\nI looked at her dead in the eye and said ''Make a comment like that one more time and I'll have a word with your manager''. She looked scared and I walked away.\n\nI told my friend this and he said it was an asshole thing, but I thought it was acceptable because her comment was rude and out of line. AITA?\n\n**Edit - she wasn't making a joke. I was there, and none of you lot were. She said it seriously.**", "My girlfriend started going to therapy for anxiety and such. I usually ask what they talked about when we talk about our days, and she told me she told her therapist about the ins and outs of our relationship, including sex and intimacy. I asked her not to do that anymore because that should be private, and she accused me of interfering with her progress. AITA for this request?", "We've got twins, Sara and Syed.  They're 14 and entering High School this year.  For clothes shopping, I decided I'd just give them some money and let them buy whatever they want with minimal oversight.  I told them both I'd give them $300 now, and another $300 for Winter.  My idea is they're old enough to budget and make these kinds of decisions for themselves.  They can spend the money online, or at the mall, whatever they want.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo they both said they wanted to go to the mall and I went with them.  I wanted to just let them loose, but my 2 14 year olds walking around with $600 didn't sit well with me.  We had a few conversations about the most efficient way to do this.  Figure out what you NEED, and what you WANT.  Find out the stores you want to shop at, get an idea about their prices, then when we get to the mall do a walkthru at all of these stores and find out what kind of deals they have and what items you want.  Then go back, try shit on, and buy what you like.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSyed took my advice well.  He went into a few stores, and found the ones that had the best deals that he wanted.  He bought 3 pairs of pants for $100, 5 shirts for $100, then a pair of Vans on clearance for $30.  He had money left over so he bought a video game.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSara kinda just casually shopped through the stores and bought what she liked.  All of the prices were reasonable so I didn't say much.  She actually ended up with about 2x the amount of clothes (plus accessories) Syed did.  But Sara started complaining that it wasn't enough money to get everything she needed.  I told her then she can return some stuff and buy what she needed somewhere else?  She said no, what she already bought is stuff she needs so that wouldn't help.  I said oh well, thems the brakes.  You gotta budget better and prioritize.  She'll get more money in a couple of months.  She was unhappy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we got home Sara cried to my Wife   She complained that its unfair her and Syed get the same amount because girls have more needs when it comes to clothes than boys.  She points out that she had to spend $50 just on underwear, while Syed paid $0.  I actually demanded they both spend $30 to buy socks and underwear that I paid for personally, separate from the $300.  Why does a 14 year old girl need to spend $80 on underwear?  Obviously she already has underwear, and I'm giving her more money in a few months.  I would just buy her more underwear if she really needed it anyway.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth Wife and Sara insist that Syed can just pretty much wear the same shit every day and no one would care.  But as a girl, she needs at least 2 weeks worth of unique outfits plus matching accessories.  Its not about spending the same amount on both kids, its about spending enough to put them on the same social level.  I'm not sure if thats true.", "AITA for refusing to bleach a woman's hair? \n\nNew account. SO thinks I handled the situation poorly, but I think what I did was right. \n\nSo I (26F) work part-time as an independent hairdresser.  I have a mini salon set up at home and I attract clients mostly through word of mouth. \n\nTwo days ago a new client booked in with me at 3 o'clock to have her hair trimmed and bleached blonde (she wanted to go from her natural  colour to an icey blonde). I've lost quite a lot of clients recently due to relocation,  so I was keen to impress this woman and work on building my client base up again. \n\nHowever,  when this woman came in at 3 o'clock,  I could immediately tell that her hair was in terrible condition. \n\nHer hair looked extremely fragile and thin. Her ends were badly split and on the crown of her head there were parts of her hair that were so thin you could see the scalp through the hair. When she sat down in her chair I - very gently - ran my fingers through her hair and there was an abnormal amount of breakage just from running my fingers through. This woman was in her early to mid 30s and it was pretty clear she was suffering from hair loss.\n\nSo I, very delicately, explained to my client that I was happy to trim her hair but I wouldn't be bleaching it for her today  because the condition of her hair wasn't currently healthy enough to bleach and withstand the chemical treatment. To my surprise,  the client insisted that her hair was in fact healthy and she needed to go blonde.\n\nI used my hand mirror to show her the parts of her crown that were balding and the thinness of her ends so she would understand that she had a serious hair loss problem..\n\n Even then the client insisted that her hair was maybe a little unhealthy but not that bad and she still wanted the bleaching done. \n\nIt became pretty obvious that the client was in denial about her hair loss. However,  bleach is a harsh chemical that would further damage her already fragile hair. \n\nThis woman and I go back and forth for a while and she is not budging about wanting the bleaching done. Eventually I put my foot down and tell the client that I refuse to bleach her hair  because it could further aggravate her hair loss and I do not want to be responsible for her losing anymore of her hair. If she wants her hair bleached she can find another hairdresser to do it for her,  but in my professional opinion, she should be going straight to a doctor and/or dermatologist.\n\nThe clients gets the message and leaves visibly upset. I just know she will leave a bad review but to be honest I don't care. There was no way I could bleach her hair and feel good about it afterwards. \n\nI admit maybe towards the end when I was trying to talk her out of bleaching her hair I got quite frustrated and maybe I came across as very blunt and harsh.\n\n\nAITA ?", "My ex and I split over a year ago.  He had been cheating on me.  He wanted to and still wants to work through it, but that\u2019s not even a possibility.  I have a son who will soon be 16.  The divorce was hard on him, especially because he didn\u2019t understand why it was happening.  I just told him that his father and I couldn\u2019t make it work anymore and that these things sometimes happen.  It\u2019s never been a good enough reason for him.  \n\nHis father takes him every other weekend.  He\u2019s been filling my son\u2019s head with ideas of us some day getting back together.  Then I get to explain to my son that it\u2019s not going to happen.  Of course at that point I get to deal with his anger at the situation.  The way he saw it was that I kicked his father out of the house, split up our marriage, and am now unwilling to even try to work through it with his poor victim of a father.  \n\nIve talked to my ex about him bringing our son into our issues before.  His response was that if his son is going to come to him to talk to him, he\u2019s not going to lie about his feelings.  To which I responded, no, but you\u2019ll sure leave a hell of a lot out of it to make me the bad guy.  Then it just turned into an argument before he left. \n\nMy son was giving me attitude recently and I got to the bottom of it.  Apparently my ex is being evicted and my son wants me to let him sleep on the couch until he finds another place.  I said that\u2019s not going to happen and he said that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t even ask.  Then went on about how this used to be his house too and I\u2019m the one who divorced him and won\u2019t try get back together.  It\u2019s not fair that I treat him like shit over nothing. \n\nI had enough of this bullshit.  I told him it wasn\u2019t over nothing, his father had been cheating on me and he got caught.  He\u2019s the reason our marriage ended.  It was his choices that got us here and he can sleep on the street as far I care.  My son said that I was lying and stormed out.  After he calmed down he came back, but doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.  I\u2019ve been trying to give him some space to process everything.  \n\nI do regret that it came out in anger instead of though out discussion, but my ex misleading him has been getting his hopes up for nothing and then damaging my relationship with him when I dash them.  I tried talking to him about it and he kept it up, I\u2019m not sure what else I could\u2019ve done.  ", "I have been in my 14-year-old step-daughter\u2019s life for 6 years now. She lives with us most of the time, goes to her mother\u2019s for two weekends out of the month. We are very close and I am glad she feels she can go to me about stuff. A couple of years ago, she came to me and said she had started her period. I got her situated and gave her the stuff she needed. She asked me to text her mom about it, but asked that I not tell her dad. I asked why and she said it was just weird, she didn\u2019t feel like he needed to know what was going on with \u201cgirl stuff\u201d. Honestly, it didn\u2019t seem like a big deal. It wasn\u2019t life or death, and I was telling one of her biological parents. I figured that her mom might tell him anyway. Anecdotally, my mom told my dad even after I asked her not to and I hated that, so admittedly, that did add to my reasoning.\n\nFast forward to now. My husband found out when he went to borrow something from my step-daughter\u2019s bathroom and found a box of pads. He wasn\u2019t upset with her, but asked if I knew. I said, yeah and explained the situation. He said I should\u2019ve told him. I said I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal and said that her mom knew, which to me covered all the bases for this part of her life. I added at the time, those were all the people she wanted to know. He\u2019s not angry with me like I said, but he just thinks it\u2019s something that a father should be informed about. Now I feel guilty.\n\nAITA for not telling him?", "Using a throwaway since fiance and I are several of the same subs. \n\nThis is a scenario where I know I fucked up in so many ways but was I the asshole? \n\nLast night was me and Fiance's 4 year anniversary of her asking me out. We have a great relationship, wedding planned for December and I really do love her. We went to a semi upscale but casual Italian place that she loves. Served seemed friendly but after her fried few trips to the table my fianc\u00e9 said \"babe she's flirting with you.\" I was like no way (I'm not one of those guys who gets flirted with) but I started paying attention and sure enough she was defintely being super polite to me and sort of under handed and dismissive to my fianc\u00e9. I tried to tell my fianc\u00e9 I saw it now but let's not let it ruin our dinner. It just got worse as the server was making far too many trips to our table and as the bill and card was being returned the server did this pouty look and told me \"i didn't get so many likes on my last Instagram post will you check it out?\" And she shoved her phone oh my face and it was her in bikini.\n\nmy fianc\u00e9 finally exploded and told the server how she'd been rude and dismissive all night and she wanted to see the manager. The server was pretty rude in her tone and said \"how about I get you a piece tiramisu on me?\" My fianc\u00e9 said \"that's fucking it, we're leaving!\" And stormed out of the restaurant. \n\nI was so stunned I had no idea what to do because I didn't want to leave her outside by herself and I assumed we weren't dining and dashing so I grabbed the bill, hurriedly filled in a tip amount that made sense, copied it over to my version of the check and left.\n\nWe drove home and my fianc\u00e9 was on fire, she was so mad I was totally agreeing with her and saying that the server had crossed so many lines and we'd never go back. At a light she said the server probably wrote her number on the check and she wanted to see it. I fished it out of my wallet and then she really freaked out. She said I tipped her $50! I was like no, I did $20 or somthing because i was in a hurry to catch up with her and didn't do exact math. She was like \"no you fucking asshole you tipped her $50!\" I asked her to show me the check and sure enough $50 on a $76 tab. I even totaled it to $126. I was ao sure to copy the numbers over exactly from the server copy of the bill I'm so afraid this right.\n\nWell fianc\u00e9 is even more furious now because she thinks this is solid proof I enjoyed the flirting and is questing what went on in the restaurant after she left. I tried to explain I was nervous and in a rush and I literally didn't see the sever again. She doesn't believe any of it. We were supposed to have a romantic night at our new house but she wanted to go back to her apartment and didn't even say goodbye as she slammed the door to my truck and I think she has my number blocked.\n\nWas I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: I guess I\u2019ve been banned for trying to point out the blatant karma farming and then arguing about it with the farmer. That\u2019s all on me. But I\u2019m not ignoring anyone and judgments. But this is 200% factual and the way it happened sorry if people don\u2019t believe it. My best explanation is a suck in conflict and really screwed up\n\nedit2: guys I screwed up, but there's no need to insult my girlfriend", "**Edit: Okay, I am the asshole. I accept that.**\n\n**However, I have seen no convincing arguments about why Josh doesn't deserve to know before getting married, and everyone here has just disregarded his feelings out of hatred for my actions (fair enough).**\n\n**Given that, I don't regret my actions, and will do it again if she doesn't tell her future partners before getting married. I am an asshole, but a necessary asshole.**\n\n-----------------------------\n\nMy sister (30) is engaged to a guy (33), let's call him Josh. Josh is a very well established guy, very nice to my sister and our family, does a lot for us.\n\nJosh and my sister announced their engagement a couple of months ago at a family dinner. Obviously everyone celebrates at the news and has a great night.... Except for me.\n\nI took my sister aside  later in the night and asked her if she had told him about her \"past\". My sister went through an extremely \"sex positive\" phase in college and slept with easily over 100 guys (we're twins btw, so always been close). She said it didn't matter, it was the past, etc. Fair enough, it shouldn't matter, but I think Josh deserves to know this before he marries my sister. Not every man is comfortable with marrying someone with such an extensive list of past sexual partners.\n\nSo anyway I tell her if she doesn't tell him, I will. I give her a month. She doesn't tell him. Meanwhile they're going full steam ahead planning the wedding. I give her one last chance, a few more weeks to come clean, she doesn't.\n\nSo I told Josh all I knew about her sexual past. He thanks me, but doesn't take the news well. Apparantly my sister has been presenting herself as a sexually-shy kind of girl. (**edit: she lied and said he was her third sexual partner**). Completely blindsided him.\n\nHe's put the wedding on hold and hasn't spoken to my sister for several days. Says he needs time alone to think.\n\nAs you can imagine, everyone in my family is blaming me for ruining my sister's wedding (I guess I kind of did). Josh's family is kind of neutral, though they're obviously offering Josh emotional support and thanking me for my honesty.\n\nAITA?"], "label": ["ESH", "NAH", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "YTA", "NTA", "NTA",
